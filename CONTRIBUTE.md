# How to contribute to the IR Anthology

The IR Anthology is a project from and for the Information Retrieval community. So any help is greatly appreciated. Depending on what you want to do there are different ways to contribute outlined below.

## Spotted an error?

With so many papers and different sources, errors will inevitably sneak in. You can open a ticket in the [IR Anthology issue tracker](https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=file-a-correction.md&title=Correction+to+XYZ) and we will take care of it.

Note: We source a lot of data from the [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/). If you can find the same problem in their bibliography, it would be better to [file a report with DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/faq/1474623.html) and fix the problem upstream.

## Missing venues or links

It takes some time for upstream sources to have data on venues available and for us to update the IR Anthology. We also have certain technical limitations that currently prevent us from sourcing data on specific venues. But we might just have overlooked something.

You have the option to suggest to add venues, workshops, IR societies, summer schools or books. Check the [IR Anthology issue tracker](https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for existing requests or [suggest an addition](https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology/edit/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-venue.md).

(There is also the option to [manually add data on venues](https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology-data/blob/master/doc/custom-bib-files.md) not covered by our sources already, which requires some manual work.)

## Bugs

For issues not directly related to metadata or the documents you can [open a bug report](https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.md&title=Bug+report).
