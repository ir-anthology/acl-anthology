We present the IR Anthology, a corpus of information retrieval publications accessible via a metadata browser and a full-text searchengine. Following the example of the well-known **[ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/)**, the IR Anthology serves as a hub for researchers interested in information retrieval.

This repository contains the code for the build of the static website. To deploy the website you need to extract the meta data first. 

See https://github.com/ir-anthology/ir-anthology-stack for the full path from downloading the data to serving the static website.

### People

### Acknowledgments

Thanks to the **[dblp](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/)** computer science bibliography for providing their curated dataset as open data. It serves as the primary data source for the meta information of this project.

Thanks to the **[ACL Anthology](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/)** for releasing their software stack to build the ACL Anthology website, which we adapted to build the IR Anthology.
