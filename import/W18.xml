    <abstract>
      Automated scoring engines are usually trained and evaluated against human
      scores and compared to the benchmark of human-human agreement. In this
      paper we compare the performance of an automated speech scoring engine
      using two corpora: a corpus of almost 700,000 randomly sampled spoken
      responses with scores assigned by one or two raters during operational
      scoring, and a corpus of 16,500 exemplar responses with scores reviewed by
      multiple expert raters. We show that the choice of corpus used for model
      evaluation has a major effect on estimates of system performance with r
      varying between 0.64 and 0.80. Surprisingly, this is not the case for the
      choice of corpus for model training: when the training corpus is
      sufficiently large, the systems trained on different corpora showed almost
      identical performance when evaluated on the same corpus. We show that this
      effect is consistent across several learning algorithms. We conclude that
      evaluating the model on a corpus of exemplar responses if one is available
      provides additional evidence about system validity; at the same time,
      investing effort into creating a corpus of exemplar responses for model
      training is unlikely to lead to a substantial gain in model performance.

    <abstract>
      When interpreting questions in a virtual patient dialogue system one must
      inevitably tackle the challenge of a long tail of relatively infrequently
      asked questions. To make progress on this challenge, we investigate the
      use of paraphrasing for data augmentation and neural memory-based
      classification, finding that the two methods work best in combination. In
      particular, we find that the neural memory-based approach not only
      outperforms a straight CNN classifier on low frequency questions, but also
      takes better advantage of the augmented data created by paraphrasing,
      together yielding a nearly 10\% absolute improvement in accuracy on the
      least frequently asked questions.

    <abstract>
      We present the first work on predicting reading mistakes in children with
      reading difficulties based on eye-tracking data from real-world reading
      teaching. Our approach employs several linguistic and gaze-based features
      to inform an ensemble of different classifiers, including multi-task
      learning models that let us transfer knowledge about individual readers to
      attain better predictions. Notably, the data we use in this work stems
      from noisy readings in the wild, outside of controlled lab conditions. Our
      experiments show that despite the noise and despite the small fraction of
      misreadings, gaze data improves the performance more than any other
      feature group and our models achieve good performance. We further show
      that gaze patterns for misread words do not fully generalize across
      readers, but that we can transfer some knowledge between readers using
      multitask learning at least in some cases. Applications of our models
      include partial automation of reading assessment as well as personalized
      text simplification.

    <abstract>
      Input material at the appropriate level is crucial for language
      acquisition. Automating the search for such material can systematically
      and efficiently support teachers in their pedagogical practice. This is
      the goal of the computational linguistic task of automatic input
      enrichment (Chinkina and Meurers, 2016): It analyzes and re-ranks a
      collection of texts in order to prioritize those containing target
      linguistic forms. In the online study described in the paper, we collected
      240 responses from English teachers in order to investigate whether they
      preferred automatic input enrichment over web search when selecting
      reading material for class. Participants demonstrated a general preference
      for the material provided by an automatic input enrichment system. It was
      also rated significantly higher than the texts retrieved by a standard web
      search engine with regard to the representation of linguistic forms and
      equivalent with regard to the relevance of the content to the topic. We
      discuss the implications of the results for language teaching and consider
      the potential strands of future research.

    <abstract>
      Evaluation of text difficulty is important both for downstream tasks like
      text simplification, and for supporting educators in classrooms. Existing
      work on automated text complexity analysis uses linear models with
      engineered knowledge-driven features as inputs. While this offers
      interpretability, these models have lower accuracy for shorter texts.
      Traditional readability metrics have the additional drawback of not
      generalizing to informational texts such as science. We propose a neural
      approach, training on science and other informational texts, to mitigate
      both problems. Our results show that neural methods outperform
      knowledge-based linear models for short texts, and have the capacity to
      generalize to genres not present in the training data.

      We present the task of 
      <i>second language acquisition (SLA) modeling</i>
      . Given a history of errors made by learners of a second language, the
      task is to predict errors that they are likely to make at arbitrary points
      in the future. We describe a large corpus of more than 7M words produced
      by more than 6k learners of English, Spanish, and French using Duolingo, a
      popular online language-learning app. Then we report on the results of a
      shared task challenge aimed studying the SLA task via this corpus, which
      attracted 15 teams and synthesized work from various fields including
      cognitive science, linguistics, and machine learning.

      We report the findings of the second Complex Word Identification (CWI)
      shared task organized as part of the BEA workshop co-located with
      NAACL-HLT’2018. The second CWI shared task featured multilingual and
      multi-genre datasets divided into four tracks: English monolingual, German
      monolingual, Spanish monolingual, and a multilingual track with a French
      test set, and two tasks: binary classification and probabilistic
      classification. A total of 12 teams submitted their results in different
      task/track combinations and 11 of them wrote system description papers
      that are referred to in this report and appear in the BEA workshop
      proceedings.

      In this paper we present work-in-progress where we investigate the
      usefulness of previously created word lists to the task of single-word
      lexical complexity analysis and prediction of the complexity level for
      learners of Swedish as a second language. The word lists used map each
      word to a single CEFR level, and the task consists of predicting CEFR
      levels for unseen words. In contrast to previous work on word-level
      lexical complexity, we experiment with topics as additional features and
      show that linking words to topics significantly increases accuracy of
      classification.

      This paper presents COAST, a web-based application to easily and
      automatically enhance syllable structure, word stress, and spacing in
      texts, that was designed in close collaboration with learning therapists
      to ensure its practical relevance. Such syllable-enhanced texts are
      commonly used in learning therapy or private tuition to promote the
      recognition of syllables in order to improve reading and writing skills.
      In a state of the art solutions for automatic syllable enhancement, we put
      special emphasis on syllable stress and support specific marking of the
      primary syllable stress in words. Core features of our tool are i) a
      highly customizable text enhancement and template functionality, and ii) a
      novel crowd-sourcing mechanism that we employ to address the issue of data
      sparsity in language resources. We successfully tested COAST with
      real-life practitioners in a series of user tests validating the concept
      of our framework.

      Given that all users of a language can be creative in their language
      usage, the overarching goal of this work is to investigate issues of
      variability and acceptability in written text, for both non-native
      speakers (NNSs) and native speakers (NSs). We control for meaning by
      collecting a dataset of picture description task (PDT) responses from a
      number of NSs and NNSs, and we define and annotate a handful of features
      pertaining to form and meaning, to capture the multi-dimensional ways in
      which responses can vary and can be acceptable. By examining the decisions
      made in this corpus development, we highlight the questions facing anyone
      working with learner language properties like variability, acceptability
      and native-likeness. We find reliable inter-annotator agreement, though
      disagreements point to difficult areas for establishing a link between
      form and meaning.

      Classroom discussions in English Language Arts have a positive effect on
      students’ reading, writing and reasoning skills. Although prior work has
      largely focused on teacher talk and student-teacher interactions, we focus
      on three theoretically-motivated aspects of high-quality student talk:
      argumentation, specificity, and knowledge domain. We introduce an
      annotation scheme, then show that the scheme can be used to produce
      reliable annotations and that the annotations are predictive of discussion
      quality. We also highlight opportunities provided by our scheme for
      education and natural language processing research.

      While dialog systems have been widely deployed for computer-assisted
      language learning (CALL) and formative assessment systems in recent years,
      relatively limited work has been done with respect to the psychometrics
      and validity of these technologies in evaluating and providing feedback
      regarding student learning and conversational ability. This paper
      formulates a Markov decision process based measurement model, and applies
      it to text chat data collected from crowdsourced native and non-native
      English language speakers interacting with an automated dialog agent. We
      investigate how well the model measures speaker conversational ability,
      and find that it effectively captures the differences in how native and
      non-native speakers of English accomplish the dialog task. Such models
      could have important implications for CALL systems of the future that
      effectively combine dialog management with measurement of learner
      conversational ability in real-time.

    <abstract>
      While immediate feedback on learner language is often discussed in the
      Second Language Acquisition literature (e.g., Mackey 2006), few systems
      used in real-life educational settings provide helpful, metalinguistic
      feedback to learners. In this paper, we present a novel approach
      leveraging task information to generate the expected range of well-formed
      and ill-formed variability in learner answers along with the required
      diagnosis and feedback. We combine this offline generation approach with
      an online component that matches the actual student answers against the
      pre-computed hypotheses. The results obtained for a set of 33 thousand
      answers of 7th grade German high school students learning English show
      that the approach successfully covers frequent answer patterns. At the
      same time, paraphrases and content errors require a more flexible
      alignment approach, for which we are planning to complement the method
      with the CoMiC approach successfully used for the analysis of reading
      comprehension answers (Meurers et al., 2011).

      In this paper, we introduce NT2Lex, a novel lexical resource for Dutch as
      a foreign language (NT2) which includes frequency distributions of 17,743
      words and expressions attested in expert-written textbook texts and
      readers graded along the scale of the Common European Framework of
      Reference (CEFR). In essence, the lexicon informs us about what kind of
      vocabulary should be understood when reading Dutch as a non-native reader
      at a particular proficiency level. The main novelty of the resource with
      respect to the previously developed CEFR-graded lexicons concerns the
      introduction of corpus-based evidence for L2 word sense complexity through
      the linkage to Open Dutch WordNet (Postma et al., 2016). The resource thus
      contains, on top of the lemmatised and part-of-speech tagged lexical
      entries, a total of 11,999 unique word senses and 8,934 distinct synsets.

      The Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) guidelines describe
      language proficiency of learners on a scale of 6 levels. While the
      description of CEFR guidelines is generic across languages, the
      development of automated proficiency classification systems for different
      languages follow different approaches. In this paper, we explore universal
      CEFR classification using domain-specific and domain-agnostic,
      theory-guided as well as data-driven features. We report the results of
      our preliminary experiments in monolingual, cross-lingual, and
      multilingual classification with three languages: German, Czech, and
      Italian. Our results show that both monolingual and multilingual models
      achieve similar performance, and cross-lingual classification yields
      lower, but comparable results to monolingual classification.

      We present a neural recommendation model for Chengyu, which is a special
      type of Chinese idiom. Given a query, which is a sentence with an empty
      slot where the Chengyu is taken out, our model will recommend the best
      Chengyu candidate that best fits the slot context. The main challenge lies
      in that the literal meaning of a Chengyu is usually very different from
      it’s figurative meaning. We propose a new neural approach to leverage the
      definition of each Chengyu and incorporate it as background knowledge.
      Experiments on both Chengyu cloze test and coherence checking in college
      entrance exams show that our system achieves 89.5% accuracy on cloze test
      and outperforms human subjects who attended competitive universities in
      China. We will make all of our data sets and resources publicly available
      as a new benchmark for research purposes.

      This paper presents the participation of the LaSTUS/TALN team in the
      Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task 2018 in the English
      monolingual track . The purpose of the task was to determine if a word in
      a given sentence can be judged as complex or not by a certain target
      audience. For the English track, task organizers provided a training and a
      development datasets of 27,299 and 3,328 words respectively together with
      the sentence in which each word occurs. The words were judged as complex
      or not by 20 human evaluators; ten of whom are natives. We submitted two
      systems: one system modeled each word to evaluate as a numeric vector
      populated with a set of lexical, semantic and contextual features while
      the other system relies on a word embedding representation and a distance
      metric. We trained two separate classifiers to automatically decide if
      each word is complex or not. We submitted six runs, two for each of the
      three subsets of the English monolingual CWI track.

      We approach the 2018 Shared Task on Complex Word Identification by
      leveraging a cross-lingual multitask learning approach. Our method is
      highly language agnostic, as evidenced by the ability of our system to
      generalize across languages, including languages for which we have no
      training data. In the shared task, this is the case for French, for which
      our system achieves the best performance. We further provide a qualitative
      and quantitative analysis of which words pose problems for our system.

    <abstract>
      In this paper, we present a kernel-based learning approach for the 2018
      Complex Word Identification (CWI) Shared Task. Our approach is based on
      combining multiple low-level features, such as character n-grams, with
      high-level semantic features that are either automatically learned using
      word embeddings or extracted from a lexical knowledge base, namely
      WordNet. After feature extraction, we employ a kernel method for the
      learning phase. The feature matrix is first transformed into a normalized
      kernel matrix. For the binary classification task (simple versus complex),
      we employ Support Vector Machines. For the regression task, in which we
      have to predict the complexity level of a word (a word is more complex if
      it is labeled as complex by more annotators), we employ v-Support Vector
      Regression. We applied our approach only on the three English data sets
      containing documents from Wikipedia, WikiNews and News domains. Our best
      result during the competition was the third place on the English Wikipedia
      data set. However, in this paper, we also report better post-competition
      results.

      We introduce the TMU systems for the Complex Word Identification (CWI)
      Shared Task 2018. TMU systems use random forest classifiers and regressors
      whose features are the number of characters, the number of words, and the
      frequency of target words in various corpora. Our simple systems performed
      best on 5 tracks out of 12 tracks. Our ablation analysis revealed the
      usefulness of a learner corpus for CWI task.

      In this paper, we present an effective system using voting ensemble
      classifiers to detect contextually complex words for non-native English
      speakers. To make the final decision, we channel a set of eight calibrated
      classifiers based on lexical, size and vocabulary features and train our
      model with annotated datasets collected from a mixture of native and
      non-native speakers. Thereafter, we test our system on three datasets
      namely News, WikiNews, and Wikipedia and report competitive results with
      an F1-Score ranging between 0.777 to 0.855 for each of the datasets. Our
      system outperforms multiple other models and falls within 0.042 to 0.026
      percent of the best-performing model’s score in the shared task.

      We present our submission to the 2018 Duolingo Shared Task on Second
      Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM). We focus on evaluating a range of
      features for the task, including user-derived measures, while examining
      how far we can get with a simple linear classifier. Our analysis reveals
      that errors differ per exercise format, which motivates our final and
      best-performing system: a task-wise (per exercise-format) model.

    <abstract>
      SLAM 2018 focuses on predicting a student’s mistake while using the
      Duolingo application. In this paper, we describe the system we developed
      for this shared task. Our system uses a logistic regression model to
      predict the likelihood of a student making a mistake while answering an
      exercise on Duolingo in all three language tracks - English/Spanish
      (en/es), Spanish/English (es/en) and French/English (fr/en). We conduct an
      ablation study with several features during the development of this system
      and discover that context based features plays a major role in language
      acquisition modeling. Our model beats Duolingo’s baseline scores in all
      three language tracks (AUROC scores for en/es = 0.821, es/en = 0.790 and
      fr/en = 0.812). Our work makes a case for providing favourable textual
      context for students while learning second language.

      Accurate prediction of students’ knowledge is a fundamental building block
      of personalized learning systems. Here, we propose an ensemble model to
      predict student knowledge gaps. Applying our approach to student trace
      data from the online educational platform Duolingo we achieved highest
      score on all three datasets in the 2018 Shared Task on Second Language
      Acquisition Modeling. We describe our model and discuss relevance of the
      task compared to how it would be setup in a production environment for
      personalized education.

      Psychological research on learning and memory has tended to emphasize
      small-scale laboratory studies. However, large datasets of people using
      educational software provide opportunities to explore these issues from a
      new perspective. In this paper we describe our approach to the Duolingo
      Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM) competition which was run in
      early 2018. We used a well-known class of algorithms (gradient boosted
      decision trees), with features partially informed by theories from the
      psychological literature. After detailing our modeling approach and a
      number of supplementary simulations, we reflect on the degree to which
      psychological theory aided the model, and the potential for cognitive
      science and predictive modeling competitions to gain from each other.

      In this paper, we explore a variety of lin- guistic and cognitive features
      to better un- derstand second language acquisition in early users of the
      language learning app Duolingo. With these features, we trained a random
      forest classifier to predict errors in early learners of French, Spanish,
      and English. Of particular note was our finding that mean and variance in
      error for each user and token can be a memory efficient replacement for
      their respective dummy- encoded categorical variables. At test, the- se
      models improved over the baseline model with AUROC values of 0.803 for
      English, 0.823 for French, and 0.829 for Spanish.

      Studies of writing revisions rarely focus on revision quality. To address
      this issue, we introduce a corpus of between-draft revisions of student
      argumentative essays, annotated as to whether each revision improves essay
      quality. We demonstrate a potential usage of our annotations by developing
      a machine learning model to predict revision improvement. With the goal of
      expanding training data, we also extract revisions from a dataset edited
      by expert proofreaders. Our results indicate that blending expert and
      non-expert revisions increases model performance, with expert data
      particularly important for predicting low-quality revisions.

      Since the end of the CoNLL-2014 shared task on grammatical error
      correction (GEC), research into language model (LM) based approaches to
      GEC has largely stagnated. In this paper, we re-examine LMs in GEC and
      show that it is entirely possible to build a simple system that not only
      requires minimal annotated data ($$1000 sentences), but is also fairly
      competitive with several state-of-the-art systems. This approach should be
      of particular interest for languages where very little annotated training
      data exists, although we also hope to use it as a baseline to motivate
      future research.

      We present a novel rule-based system for automatic generation of factual
      questions from sentences, using semantic role labeling (SRL) as the main
      form of text analysis. The system is capable of generating both
      wh-questions and yes/no questions from the same semantic analysis. We
      present an extensive evaluation of the system and compare it to a recent
      neural network architecture for question generation. The SRL-based system
      outperforms the neural system in both average quality and variety of
      generated questions.

      Technology is transforming Higher Education learning and teaching. This
      paper reports on a project to examine how and why automated content
      analysis could be used to assess precis writing by university students. We
      examine the case of one hundred and twenty-two summaries written by
      computer science freshmen. The texts, which had been hand scored using a
      teacher-designed rubric, were autoscored using the Natural Language
      Processing software, PyrEval. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and
      Spearman rank correlation were used to analyze the relationship between
      the teacher score and the PyrEval score for each summary. Three content
      models automatically constructed by PyrEval from different sets of human
      reference summaries led to consistent correlations, showing that the
      approach is reliable. Also observed was that, in cases where the focus of
      student assessment centers on formative feedback, categorizing the PyrEval
      scores by examining the average and standard deviations could lead to
      novel interpretations of their relationships. It is suggested that this
      project has implications for the ways in which automated content analysis
      could be used to help university students improve their summarization
      skills.

    <abstract>
      There has been an increase in popularity of data-driven question answering
      systems given their recent success. This pa-per explores the possibility
      of building a tutorial question answering system for Java programming from
      data sampled from a community-based question answering forum. This paper
      reports on the creation of a dataset that could support building such a
      tutorial question answering system and discusses the methodology to create
      the 106,386 question strong dataset. We investigate how retrieval-based
      and generative models perform on the given dataset. The work also
      investigates the usefulness of using hybrid approaches such as combining
      retrieval-based and generative models. The results indicate that building
      data-driven tutorial systems using community-based question answering
      forums holds significant promise.

      We investigate how machine learning models, specifically ranking models,
      can be used to select useful distractors for multiple choice questions.
      Our proposed models can learn to select distractors that resemble those in
      actual exam questions, which is different from most existing unsupervised
      ontology-based and similarity-based methods. We empirically study
      feature-based and neural net (NN) based ranking models with experiments on
      the recently released SciQ dataset and our MCQL dataset. Experimental
      results show that feature-based ensemble learning methods (random forest
      and LambdaMART) outperform both the NN-based method and unsupervised
      baselines. These two datasets can also be used as benchmarks for
      distractor generation.

      In this paper we present NLI-PT, the first Portuguese dataset compiled for
      Native Language Identification (NLI), the task of identifying an author’s
      first language based on their second language writing. The dataset
      includes 1,868 student essays written by learners of European Portuguese,
      native speakers of the following L1s: Chinese, English, Spanish, German,
      Russian, French, Japanese, Italian, Dutch, Tetum, Arabic, Polish, Korean,
      Romanian, and Swedish. NLI-PT includes the original student text and four
      different types of annotation: POS, fine-grained POS, constituency parses,
      and dependency parses. NLI-PT can be used not only in NLI but also in
      research on several topics in the field of Second Language Acquisition and
      educational NLP. We discuss possible applications of this dataset and
      present the results obtained for the first lexical baseline system for
      Portuguese NLI.

      Some language exams have multiple writing tasks. When a learner writes
      multiple texts in a language exam, it is not surprising that the quality
      of these texts tends to be similar, and the existing automated text
      scoring (ATS) systems do not explicitly model this similarity. In this
      paper, we suggest that it could be useful to include the other texts
      written by this learner in the same exam as extra references in an ATS
      system. We propose various approaches of fusing information from multiple
      tasks and pass this authorship knowledge into our ATS model on six
      different datasets. We show that this can positively affect the model
      performance at a global level.

      Swedish concerning the classification of words into proficiency levels. We
      investigate different features for English and compare their usefulness
      using feature selection methods. For the German, Spanish and French data
      we use simple systems based on character n-gram models and show that
      sometimes simple models achieve comparable results to fully
      feature-engineered systems.

      We describe the systems of NLP-CIC team that participated in the Complex
      Word Identification (CWI) 2018 shared task. The shared task aimed to
      benchmark approaches for identifying complex words in English and other
      languages from the perspective of non-native speakers. Our goal is to
      compare two approaches: feature engineering and a deep neural network.
      Both approaches achieved comparable performance on the English test set.
      We demonstrated the flexibility of the deep-learning approach by using the
      same deep neural network setup in the Spanish track. Our systems achieved
      competitive results: all our systems were within 0.01 of the system with
      the best macro-F1 score on the test sets except on Wikipedia test set, on
      which our best system is 0.04 below the best macro-F1 score.

      We describe a system for the CWI-task that includes information on 5
      aspects of the (complex) lexical item, namely distributional information
      of the item itself, morphological structure, psychological measures,
      corpus-counts and topical information. We constructed a deep learning
      architecture that combines those features and apply it to the
      probabilistic and binary classification task for all English sets and
      Spanish. We achieved reasonable performance on all sets with best
      performances seen on the probabilistic task, particularly on the English
      news set (MAE 0.054 and F1-score of 0.872). An analysis of the results
      shows that reasonable performance can be achieved with a single
      architecture without any domain-specific tweaking of the parameter
      settings and that distributional features capture almost all of the
      information also found in hand-crafted features.

      This paper describes the results of NILC team at CWI 2018. We developed
      solutions following three approaches: (i) a feature engineering method
      using lexical, n-gram and psycholinguistic features, (ii) a shallow neural
      network method using only word embeddings, and (iii) a Long Short-Term
      Memory (LSTM) language model, which is pre-trained on a large text corpus
      to produce a contextualized word vector. The feature engineering method
      obtained our best results for the classification task and the LSTM model
      achieved the best results for the probabilistic classification task. Our
      results show that deep neural networks are able to perform as well as
      traditional machine learning methods using manually engineered features
      for the task of complex word identification in English.

      This paper investigates the use of character n-gram frequencies for
      identifying complex words in English, German and Spanish texts. The
      approach is based on the assumption that complex words are likely to
      contain different character sequences than simple words. The multinomial
      Naive Bayes classifier was used with n-grams of different lengths as
      features, and the best results were obtained for the combination of
      2-grams and 4-grams. This variant was submitted to the Complex Word
      Identification Shared Task 2018 for all texts and achieved F-scores
      between 70% and 83%. The system was ranked in the middle range for all
      English texts, as third of fourteen submissions for German, and as tenth
      of seventeen submissions for Spanish. The method is not very convenient
      for the cross-language task, achieving only 59% on the French text.

      This paper describes the system developed by the Centre for English Corpus
      Linguistics for the 2018 Duolingo SLAM challenge. It aimed at predicting
      the successes and mistakes of second language learners on each of the
      words that compose the exercises they answered. Its main characteristic is
      to include conjunctive features, built by combining word ngrams with
      metadata about the user and the exercise. It achieved a relatively good
      performance, ranking fifth out of 15 systems. Complementary analyses
      carried out to gauge the contribution of the different sets of features to
      the performance confirmed the usefulness of the conjunctive features for
      the SLAM task.

      Knowledge tracing serves as a keystone in delivering personalized
      education. However, few works attempted to model students’ knowledge state
      in the setting of Second Language Acquisition. The Duolingo Shared Task on
      Second Language Acquisition Modeling provides students’ trace data that we
      extensively analyze and engineer features from for the task of predicting
      whether a student will correctly solve a vocabulary exercise. Our analyses
      of students’ learning traces reveal that factors like exercise format and
      engagement impact their exercise performance to a large extent. Overall,
      we extracted 23 different features as input to a Gradient Tree Boosting
      framework, which resulted in an AUC score of between 0.80 and 0.82 on the
      official test set.

      We introduce the TMU systems for the second language acquisition modeling
      shared task 2018 (Settles et al., 2018). To model learner error patterns,
      it is necessary to maintain a considerable amount of information regarding
      the type of exercises learners have been learning in the past and the
      manner in which they answered them. Tracking an enormous learner’s
      learning history and their correct and mistaken answers is essential to
      predict the learner’s future mistakes. Therefore, we propose a model which
      tracks the learner’s learning history efficiently. Our systems ranked
      fourth in the English and Spanish subtasks, and fifth in the French
      subtask.

      This paper introduces our solution to the 2018 Duolingo Shared Task on
      Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM). We used deep factorization
      machines, a wide and deep learning model of pairwise relationships between
      users, items, skills, and other entities considered. Our solution (AUC
      0.815) hopefully managed to beat the logistic regression baseline (AUC
      0.774) but not the top performing model (AUC 0.861) and reveals
      interesting strategies to build upon item response theory models.

      Second Language Acquisition Modeling is the task to predict whether a
      second language learner would respond correctly in future exercises based
      on their learning history. In this paper, we propose a neural network
      based system to utilize rich contextual, linguistic and user information.
      Our neural model consists of a Context encoder, a Linguistic feature
      encoder, a User information encoder and a Format information encoder
      (CLUF). Furthermore, a decoder is introduced to combine such encoded
      features and make final predictions. Our system ranked in first place in
      the English track and second place in the Spanish and French track with an
      AUROC score of 0.861, 0.835 and 0.854 respectively.

      This paper describes our use of two recurrent neural network sequence
      models: sequence labelling and sequence-to-sequence models, for the
      prediction of future learner errors in our submission to the 2018 Duolingo
      Shared Task on Second Language Acquisition Modeling (SLAM). We show that
      these two models capture complementary information as combining them
      improves performance. Furthermore, the same network architecture and group
      of features can be used directly to build competitive prediction models in
      all three language tracks, demonstrating that our approach generalises
      well across languages.

    <abstract>
      Developing plausible distractors (wrong answer options) when writing
      multiple-choice questions has been described as one of the most
      challenging and time-consuming parts of the item-writing process. In this
      paper we propose a fully automatic method for generating distractor
      suggestions for multiple-choice questions used in high-stakes medical
      exams. The system uses a question stem and the correct answer as an input
      and produces a list of suggested distractors ranked based on their
      similarity to the stem and the correct answer. To do this we use a novel
      approach of combining concept embeddings with information retrieval
      methods. We frame the evaluation as a prediction task where we aim to
      “predict” the human-produced distractors used in large sets of medical
      questions, i.e. if a distractor generated by our system is good enough it
      is likely to feature among the list of distractors produced by the human
      item-writers. The results reveal that combining concept embeddings with
      information retrieval approaches significantly improves the generation of
      plausible distractors and enables us to match around 1 in 5 of the
      human-produced distractors. The approach proposed in this paper is
      generalisable to all scenarios where the distractors refer to concepts.

      This paper presents an investigation of using a co-attention based neural

      mechanism to help the model learn the importance of each part of the essay
      more accurately. Also, this paper shows that the co-attention based neural
      network model provides reliable score prediction of source-dependent
      responses. We evaluate our model on two source-dependent response corpora.
      Results show that our model outperforms the baseline on both corpora. We
      also show that the attention of the model is similar to the expert
      opinions with examples.

    <abstract>
      We investigate the feasibility of cross-lingual content scoring, a
      scenario where training and test data in an automatic scoring task are
      from two different languages. Cross-lingual scoring can contribute to
      educational equality by allowing answers in multiple languages. Training a
      model in one language and applying it to another language might also help
      to overcome data sparsity issues by re-using trained models from other
      languages. As there is no suitable dataset available for this new task, we
      create a comparable bi-lingual corpus by extending the English ASAP
      dataset with German answers. Our experiments with cross-lingual scoring
      based on machine-translating either training or test data show a
      considerable drop in scoring quality.

    <abstract>
      Computational models to detect mental illnesses from text and speech could
      enhance our understanding of mental health while offering opportunities
      for early detection and intervention. However, these models are often
      disconnected from the lived experience of depression and the larger
      diagnostic debates in mental health. This article investigates these
      disconnects, primarily focusing on the labels used to diagnose depression,
      how these labels are computationally represented, and the performance
      metrics used to evaluate computational models. We also consider how
      medical instruments used to measure depression, such as the Patient Health
      Questionnaire (PHQ), contribute to these disconnects. To illustrate our
      points, we incorporate mixed-methods analyses of 698 interviews on
      emotional health, which are coupled with self-report PHQ screens for
      depression. We propose possible strategies to bridge these gaps between
      modern psychiatric understandings of depression, lay experience of
      depression, and computational representation.

      Automated depression detection is inherently a multimodal problem.
      Therefore, it is critical that researchers investigate fusion techniques
      for multimodal design. This paper presents the first-ever comprehensive
      study of fusion techniques for depression detection. In addition, we
      present novel linguistically-motivated fusion techniques, which we find

      We report on the creation of a dataset for studying assessment of suicide

      by experts yields what is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of
      reliability in risk assessment by clinicians based on social media
      postings. We also introduce and demonstrate the value of a new, detailed
      rubric for assessing suicide risk, compare crowdsourced with expert
      performance, and present baseline predictive modeling experiments using
      the new dataset, which will be made available to researchers through the

    <abstract>
      We describe the shared task for the CLPsych 2018 workshop, which focused
      on predicting current and future psychological health from an essay
      authored in childhood. Language-based predictions of a person’s current
      health have the potential to supplement traditional psychological
      assessment such as questionnaires, improving intake risk measurement and
      monitoring. Predictions of future psychological health can aid with both
      early detection and the development of preventative care. Research into
      the mental health trajectory of people, beginning from their childhood,
      has thus far been an area of little work within the NLP community. This
      shared task represents one of the first attempts to evaluate the use of
      early language to predict future health; this has the potential to support
      a wide variety of clinical health care tasks, from early assessment of
      lifetime risk for mental health problems, to optimal timing for targeted
      interventions aimed at both prevention and treatment.

      The Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2018
      Shared Task asked teams to predict cross-sectional indices of anxiety and
      distress, and longitudinal indices of psychological distress from a
      subsample of the National Child Development Study, started in the United
      Kingdom in 1958. Teams aimed to predict mental health outcomes from essays
      written by 11-year-olds about what they believed their lives would be like
      at age 25. In the hopes of producing results that could be easily
      disseminated and applied, we used largely theory-based dictionaries to
      process the texts, and a simple data-driven approach to model selection.
      This approach yielded only modest results in terms of out-of-sample
      accuracy, but most of the category-level findings are interpretable and
      consistent with existing literature on psychological distress, anxiety,

    <abstract>
      Mental health forums are online spaces where people can share their
      experiences anonymously and get peer support. These forums, require the
      supervision of moderators to provide support in delicate cases, such as
      posts expressing suicide ideation. The large increase in the number of
      forum users makes the task of the moderators unmanageable without the help
      of automatic triage systems. In the present paper, we present a Machine
      Learning approach for the triage of posts. Most approaches in the
      literature focus on the content of the posts, but only a few authors take
      advantage of features extracted from the context in which they appear. Our
      approach consists of the development and implementation of a large variety
      of new features from both, the content and the context of posts, such as
      previous messages, interaction with other users and author’s history. Our
      method has competed in the CLPsych 2017 Shared Task, obtaining the first
      place for several of the subtasks. Moreover, we also found that models
      that take advantage of post context improve significantly its performance
      in the detection of flagged posts (posts that require moderators
      attention), as well as those that focus on post content outperforms in the
      detection of most urgent events.

      Mental health problems represent a major public health challenge.
      Automated analysis of text related to mental health is aimed to help
      medical decision-making, public health policies and to improve health
      care. Such analysis may involve text classification. Traditionally,
      automated classification has been performed mainly using machine learning
      methods involving costly feature engineering. Recently, the performance of
      those methods has been dramatically improved by neural methods. However,
      mainly Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been explored. In this
      paper, we apply a hierarchical Recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture
      with an attention mechanism on social media data related to mental health.
      We show that this architecture improves overall classification results as
      compared to previously reported results on the same data. Benefitting from
      the attention mechanism, it can also efficiently select text elements
      crucial for classification decisions, which can also be used for in-depth
      analysis.

    <abstract>
      Depression is a global mental health condition that affects all cultures.
      Despite this, the way depression is expressed varies by culture. Uptake of
      machine learning technology for diagnosing mental health conditions means
      that increasingly more depression classifiers are created from online
      language data. Yet, culture is rarely considered as a factor affecting
      online language in this literature. This study explores cultural
      differences in online language data of users with depression. Written
      language data from 1,593 users with self-reported depression from the
      online peer support community 7 Cups of Tea was analyzed using the
      Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), topic modeling, data
      visualization, and other techniques. We compared the language of users
      identifying as White, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, and
      Asian or Pacific Islander. Exploratory analyses revealed cross-cultural
      differences in depression expression in online language data, particularly
      in relation to emotion expression, cognition, and functioning. The results
      have important implications for avoiding depression misclassification from
      machine-driven assessments when used in a clinical setting, and for
      avoiding inadvertent cultural biases in this line of research more
      broadly.

    <abstract>
      Mental illness detection in social media can be considered a complex task,
      mainly due to the complicated nature of mental disorders. In recent years,
      this research area has started to evolve with the continuous increase in
      popularity of social media platforms that became an integral part of
      people’s life. This close relationship between social media platforms and
      their users has made these platforms to reflect the users’ personal life
      with different limitations. In such an environment, researchers are
      presented with a wealth of information regarding one’s life. In addition
      to the level of complexity in identifying mental illnesses through social
      media platforms, adopting supervised machine learning approaches such as
      deep neural networks have not been widely accepted due to the difficulties
      in obtaining sufficient amounts of annotated training data. Due to these
      reasons, we try to identify the most effective deep neural network
      architecture among a few of selected architectures that were successfully
      used in natural language processing tasks. The chosen architectures are
      used to detect users with signs of mental illnesses (depression in our
      case) given limited unstructured text data extracted from the Twitter
      social media platform.

      This article is a system description and report on the submission of a
      team from the University of Pennsylvania in the ’CLPsych 2018’ shared
      task. The goal of the shared task was to use childhood language as a
      marker for both current and future psychological health over individual
      lifetimes. Our system employs multiple textual features derived from the
      essays written and individuals’ socio-demographic variables at the age of
      11. We considered several word clustering approaches, and explore the use
      of linear regression based on different feature sets. Our approach showed
      best results for predicting distress at the age of 42 and for predicting
      current anxiety on Disattenuated Pearson Correlation, and ranked fourth in
      the future health prediction task. In addition to the subtasks presented,
      we attempted to provide insight into mental health aspects at different
      ages. Our findings indicate that misspellings, words with illegible
      letters and increased use of personal pronouns are correlated with poor
      mental health at age 11, while descriptions about future physical
      activity, family and friends are correlated with good mental health.

      This paper describes the systems we developed for tasks A and B of the
      2018 CLPsych shared task. The first task (task A) focuses on predicting
      behavioral health scores at age 11 using childhood essays. The second task
      (task B) asks participants to predict future psychological distress at
      ages 23, 33, 42, and 50 using the age 11 essays. We propose two
      convolutional neural network based methods that map each task to a
      regression problem. Among seven teams we ranked third on task A with
      disattenuated Pearson correlation (DPC) score of 0.5587. Likewise, we
      ranked third on task B with an average DPC score of 0.3062.

      of children based on language used in hand-written essays and
      socio-demographic control variables. Our entry uses word- and
      character-based features as well as lexicon-based features and features
      derived from the essays such as the quality of the language. We apply
      linear models, gradient boosting as well as neural-network based

      The CLPsych 2018 Shared Task B explores how childhood essays can predict
      psychological distress throughout the author’s life. Our main aim was to
      build tools to help our psychologists understand the data, propose
      features and interpret predictions. We submitted two linear regression
      models: ModelA uses simple demographic and word- count features, while
      ModelB uses linguistic, entity, typographic, expert-gazetteer, and
      readability features. Our models perform best at younger prediction ages,
      with our best unofficial score at 23 of 0.426 disattenuated Pearson
      correlation. This task is challenging and although predictive performance
      is limited, we propose that tight integration of expertise across
      computational linguistics and clinical psychology is a productive
      direction.

    <abstract>
      Schizophrenia is a mental disorder which afflicts an estimated 0.7\% of
      adults world wide. It affects many areas of mental function, often evident
      from incoherent speech. Diagnosing schizophrenia relies on subjective
      judgments resulting in disagreements even among trained clinicians. Recent
      studies have proposed the use of natural language processing for diagnosis
      by drawing on automatically-extracted linguistic features like discourse
      coherence and lexicon. Here, we present the first benchmark comparison of
      previously proposed coherence models for detecting symptoms of
      schizophrenia and evaluate their performance on a new dataset of recorded
      interviews between subjects and clinicians. We also present two
      alternative coherence metrics based on modern sentence embedding
      techniques that outperform the previous methods on our dataset. Lastly, we
      propose a novel computational model for reference incoherence based on
      ambiguous pronoun usage and show that it is a highly predictive feature on
      our data. While the number of subjects is limited in this pilot study, our
      results suggest new directions for diagnosing common symptoms of
      schizophrenia.

    <abstract>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition
      characterized by impaired social communication and the presence of
      restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors and interests. Prior research
      suggests that restricted patterns of behavior in ASD may be cross-domain
      phenomena that are evident in a variety of modalities. Computational
      studies of language in ASD provide support for the existence of an
      underlying dimension of restriction that emerges during a conversation.
      Similar evidence exists for restricted patterns of facial movement. Using
      tools from computational linguistics, computer vision, and information
      theory, this study tests whether cognitive-motor restriction can be
      detected across multiple behavioral domains in adults with ASD during a
      naturalistic conversation. Our methods identify restricted behavioral
      patterns, as measured by entropy in word use and mouth movement. Results
      suggest that adults with ASD produce significantly less diverse mouth
      movements and words than neurotypical adults, with an increased reliance
      on repeated patterns in both domains. The diversity values of the two
      domains are not significantly correlated, suggesting that they provide
      complementary information.

    <abstract>
      Over 800000 people die of suicide each year. It is es-timated that by the
      year 2020, this figure will have in-creased to 1.5 million. It is
      considered to be one of the major causes of mortality during adolescence.
      Thus there is a growing need for methods of identifying su-icidal
      individuals. Language analysis is known to be a valuable psychodiagnostic
      tool, however the material for such an analysis is not easy to obtain.
      Currently as the Internet communications are developing, there is an
      opportunity to study texts of suicidal individuals. Such an analysis can
      provide a useful insight into the peculiarities of suicidal thinking,
      which can be used to further develop methods for diagnosing the risk of
      suicidal behavior. The paper analyzes the dynamics of a number of
      linguistic parameters of an idiostyle of a Russian-language blogger who
      died by suicide. For the first time such an analysis has been conducted
      using the material of Russian online texts. For text processing, the LIWC
      program is used. A correlation analysis was performed to identify the
      relationship between LIWC variables and number of days prior to suicide.
      Data visualization, as well as comparison with the results of related
      studies was performed.

      Self-reported diagnosis statements have been widely employed in studying
      language related to mental health in social media. However, existing
      research has largely ignored the temporality of mental health diagnoses.
      In this work, we introduce RSDD-Time: a new dataset of 598 manually
      annotated self-reported depression diagnosis posts from Reddit that
      include temporal information about the diagnosis. Annotations include
      whether a mental health con- dition is present and how recently the
      diagnosis happened. Furthermore, we include exact temporal spans that
      relate to the date of diagnosis. This information is valuable for various
      computational methods to examine mental health through social media
      because one’s mental health state is not static. We also test several
      baseline classification and extraction approaches, which suggest that
      extracting temporal information from self-reported diagnosis statements is
      challenging.

    <abstract>
      Trustfulness — one’s general tendency to have confidence in unknown people
      or situations — predicts many important real-world outcomes such as mental
      health and likelihood to cooperate with others such as clinicians. While
      data-driven measures of interpersonal trust have previously been
      introduced, here, we develop the first language-based assessment of the
      personality trait of trustfulness by fitting one’s language to an accepted
      questionnaire-based trust score. Further, using trustfulness as a type of
      case study, we explore the role of questionnaire size as well as word
      count in developing language-based predictive models of users’
      psychological traits. We find that leveraging a longer questionnaire can
      yield greater test set accuracy, while, for training, we find it
      beneficial to include users who took smaller questionnaires which offers
      more observations for training. Similarly, after noting a decrease in
      individual prediction error as word count increased, we found a word
      count-weighted training scheme was helpful when there were very few users
      in the first place.

      Although many studies have distinguished between the social media language
      use of people who do and do not have a mental health condition,
      within-person context-sensitive comparisons (for example, analyzing
      individuals’ language use when seeking support or discussing neutral
      topics) are less common. Two dictionary-based analyses of Reddit
      communities compared (1) anxious individuals’ comments in anxiety support
      communities (e.g., /r/PanicParty) with the same users’ comments in neutral
      communities (e.g., /r/todayilearned), and, (2) within popular neutral
      communities, comments by members of anxiety subreddits with comments by
      other users. Each comparison yielded theory-consistent effects as well as
      unexpected results that suggest novel hypotheses to be tested in the
      future. Results have relevance for improving researchers’ and
      practitioners’ ability to unobtrusively assess anxiety symptoms in
      conversations that are not explicitly about mental health.

    <abstract>
      In recent years, online communities have formed around suicide and
      self-harm prevention. While these communities offer support in moment of
      crisis, they can also normalize harmful behavior, discourage professional
      treatment, and instigate suicidal ideation. In this work, we focus on how
      interaction with others in such a community affects the mental state of
      users who are seeking support. We first build a dataset of conversation
      threads between users in a distressed state and community members offering
      support. We then show how to construct a classifier to predict whether
      distressed users are helped or harmed by the interactions in the thread,
      and we achieve a macro-F1 score of up to 0.69.

    <abstract>
      The ARRAU corpus is an anaphorically annotated corpus of English providing
      rich linguistic information about anaphora resolution. The most
      distinctive feature of the corpus is the annotation of a wide range of
      anaphoric relations, including bridging references and discourse deixis in
      addition to identity (coreference). Other distinctive features include
      treating all NPs as markables, including non-referring NPs; and the
      annotation of a variety of morphosyntactic and semantic mention and entity
      attributes, including the genericity status of the entities referred to by
      markables. The corpus however has not been extensively used for anaphora
      resolution research so far. In this paper, we discuss three datasets
      extracted from the ARRAU corpus to support the three subtasks of the CRAC
      2018 Shared Task–identity anaphora resolution over ARRAU-style markables,
      bridging references resolution, and discourse deixis; the evaluation
      scripts assessing system performance on those datasets; and preliminary
      results on these three tasks that may serve as baseline for subsequent
      research in these phenomena.

      We present two systems for bridging resolution, which we submitted to the
      CRAC shared task on bridging anaphora resolution in the ARRAU corpus
      (track 2): a rule-based approach following Hou et al. 2014 and a
      learning-based approach. The re-implementation of Hou et al. 2014 achieves
      very poor performance when being applied to ARRAU. We found that the
      reasons for this lie in the different bridging annotations: whereas the
      rule-based system suggests many referential bridging pairs, ARRAU contains
      mostly lexical bridging. We describe the differences between these two
      types of bridging and adapt the rule-based approach to be able to handle
      lexical bridging. The modified rule-based approach achieves reasonable
      performance on all (sub)-tasks and outperforms a simple learning-based
      approach.

      Notional anaphors are pronouns which disagree with their antecedents’
      grammatical categories for notional reasons, such as plural to singular
      agreement in: "the government ... they". Since such cases are rare and
      conflict with evidence from strictly agreeing cases ("the government ...
      it"), they present a substantial challenge to both coreference resolution
      and referring expression generation. Using the OntoNotes corpus, this
      paper takes an ensemble approach to predicting English notional anaphora
      in context on the basis of the largest empirical data to date. In addition
      to state of the art prediction accuracy, the results suggest that
      theoretical approaches positing a plural construal at the antecedent’s
      utterance are insufficient, and that circumstances at the anaphor’s
      utterance location, as well as global factors such as genre, have a strong
      effect on the choice of referring expression.

      Cases of coreference and bridging resolution often require knowledge about
      semantic relations between anaphors and antecedents. We suggest
      state-of-the-art neural-network classifiers trained on relation benchmarks
      to predict and integrate likelihoods for relations. Two experiments with
      representations differing in noise and complexity improve our bridging but
      not our coreference resolver.

      Bridging resolution is the task of recognising bridging anaphors and
      linking them to their antecedents. While there is some work on bridging
      resolution for English, there is only little work for German. We present
      two datasets which contain bridging annotations, namely DIRNDL and GRAIN,
      and compare the performance of a rule-based system with a simple baseline
      approach on these two corpora. The performance for full bridging
      resolution ranges between an F1 score of 13.6% for DIRNDL and 11.8% for
      GRAIN. An analysis using oracle lists suggests that the system could, to a
      certain extent, benefit from ranking and re-ranking antecedent candidates.
      Furthermore, we investigate the importance of single features and show
      that the features used in our work seem promising for future bridging
      resolution approaches.

      This paper describes the design and evaluation of a system for the
      automatic detection and resolution of shell nouns in German. Shell nouns
      are general nouns, such as fact, question, or problem, whose full
      interpretation relies on a content phrase located elsewhere in a text,
      which these nouns simultaneously serve to characterize and encapsulate. To
      accomplish this, the system uses a series of lexico-syntactic patterns in
      order to extract shell noun candidates and their content in parallel. Each
      pattern has its own classifier, which makes the final decision as to
      whether or not a link is to be established and the shell noun resolved.
      Overall, about 26.2\% of the annotated shell noun instances were correctly
      identified by the system, and of these cases, about 72.5\% are assigned
      the correct content phrase. Though it remains difficult to identify shell
      noun instances reliably (recall is accordingly low in this regard), this
      system usually assigns the right content to correctly classified cases.
      cases.

      We present PAWS, a multi-lingual parallel treebank with coreference
      annotation. It consists of English texts from the Wall Street Journal
      translated into Czech, Russian and Polish. In addition, the texts are
      syntactically parsed and word-aligned. PAWS is based on PCEDT 2.0 and
      continues the tradition of multilingual treebanks with coreference
      annotation. The paper focuses on the coreference annotation in PAWS and
      its language-specific differences. PAWS offers linguistic material that
      can be further leveraged in cross-lingual studies, especially on
      coreference.

      We perform a fine-grained large-scale analysis of coreference projection.
      By projecting gold coreference from Czech to English and vice versa on
      Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 Coref, we set an upper bound
      of a proposed projection approach for these two languages. We undertake a
      detailed thorough analysis that combines the analysis of projection’s
      subtasks with analysis of performance on individual mention types. The
      findings are accompanied with examples from the corpus.

      Typological differences between English and Chinese suggest stronger
      reliance on salience of the antecedent during pronoun resolution in
      Chinese. We examined this hypothesis by correlating a difficulty measure
      of pronoun resolution derived by the activation-based ACT-R model with the
      brain activity of English and Chinese participants listening to a same
      audiobook during fMRI recording. The ACT-R model predicts higher overall
      difficulty for English speakers, which is supported at the brain level in
      left Broca’s area. More generally, it confirms that computational modeling
      approach is able to dissociate different dimensions that are involved in
      the complex process of pronoun resolution in the brain.

      Anaphora resolution systems require both an enumeration of possible
      candidate antecedents and an identification process of the antecedent.
      This paper focuses on (i) the impact of the form of referring expression
      on entity-vs-event preferences and (ii) how properties of the passage
      interact with referential form. Two crowd-sourced story-continuation
      experiments were conducted, using constructed and naturally-occurring
      passages, to see how participants interpret 
      <i>
        It and This pronouns following a context sentence that makes available
        event and entity referents. Our participants show a strong, but not
        categorical, bias to use This to refer to events and It
      </i>
       to refer to entities. However, these preferences vary with passage
      characteristics such as verb class (a proxy in our constructed examples
      for the number of explicit and implicit entities) and more subtle author
      intentions regarding subsequent re-mention (the original event-vs-entity
      re-mention of our corpus items).

      On the Utility of Lay Summaries and AI Safety Disclosures: Toward Robust,

    <abstract>
      In this position paper, we propose that the community consider encouraging
      researchers to include two riders, a ”Lay Summary” and an ”AI Safety
      Disclosure”, as part of future NLP papers published in ACL forums that
      present user-facing systems. The goal is to encourage researchers–via a
      relatively non-intrusive mechanism–to consider the societal implications
      of technologies carrying (un)known and/or (un)knowable long-term risks, to
      highlight failure cases, and to provide a mechanism by which the general
      public (and scientists in other disciplines) can more readily engage in
      the discussion in an informed manner. This simple proposal requires
      minimal additional up-front costs for researchers; the lay summary, at
      least, has significant precedence in the medical literature and other
      areas of science; and the proposal is aimed to supplement, rather than
      replace, existing approaches for encouraging researchers to consider the
      ethical implications of their work, such as those of the Collaborative
      Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Program and institutional review
      boards (IRBs).

    <abstract>
      Conversational AI systems, such as Amazon’s Alexa, are rapidly developing
      from purely transactional systems to social chatbots, which can respond to
      a wide variety of user requests. In this article, we establish how current
      state-of-the-art conversational systems react to inappropriate requests,
      such as bullying and sexual harassment on the part of the user, by
      collecting and analysing the novel #MeTooAlexa corpus. Our results show
      that commercial systems mainly avoid answering, while rule-based chatbots
      show a variety of behaviours and often deflect. Data-driven systems, on
      the other hand, are often non-coherent, but also run the risk of being
      interpreted as flirtatious and sometimes react with counter-aggression.
      This includes our own system, trained on “clean” data, which suggests that
      inappropriate system behaviour is not caused by data bias.

      Poetry is known for its novel expression using figurative language. We
      introduce a writing task that contains the essential challenges of
      generating meaningful figurative language and can be evaluated. We
      investigate how to find metaphorical connections between abstract themes
      and concrete domains by asking people to write four-line poems on a given
      metaphor, such as "death is a rose" or "anger is wood". We find that only
      21% of poems successfully make a metaphorical connection. We present five
      alternate ways people respond to the prompt and release our dataset of 100
      categorized poems. We suggest opportunities for computational approaches.

      Using linguistic features to detect figurative language has provided a
      deeper in-sight into figurative language. The purpose of this study is to
      assess whether linguistic features can help explain differences in quality
      of figurative language. In this study a large corpus of metaphors and
      sarcastic responses are collected from human subjects and rated for
      figurative language quality based on theoretical components of metaphor,
      sarcasm, and creativity. Using natural language processing tools, specific
      linguistic features related to lexical sophistication and semantic
      cohesion were used to predict the human ratings of figurative language
      quality. Results demonstrate linguistic features were able to predict
      small amounts of variance in metaphor and sarcasm production quality.

      Identification of metaphoric language in text is critical for generating
      effective semantic representations for natural language understanding.
      Computational approaches to metaphor identification have largely relied on
      heuristic based models or feature-based machine learning, using
      hand-crafted lexical resources coupled with basic syntactic information.
      However, recent work has shown the predictive power of syntactic
      constructions in determining metaphoric source and target domains
      (Sullivan 2013). Our work intends to explore syntactic constructions and
      their relation to metaphoric language. We undertake a corpus-based
      analysis of predicate-argument constructions and their metaphoric
      properties, and attempt to effectively represent syntactic constructions
      as features for metaphor processing, both in identifying source and target
      domains and in distinguishing metaphoric words from non-metaphoric.

      The paper addresses the classification of isolated Polish adjective-noun
      phrases according to their metaphoricity. We tested neural networks to
      predict if a phrase has a literal or metaphorical sense or can have both
      senses depending on usage. The input to the neural network consists of
      word embeddings, but we also tested the impact of information about the
      domain of the adjective and about the abstractness of the noun. We applied
      our solution to English data available on the Internet and compared it to
      results published in papers. We found that the solution based on word
      embeddings only can achieve results comparable with complex solutions
      requiring additional information.

      This paper presents an exploratory study on large-scale detection of
      idiomatic expressions in essays written by non-native speakers of English.
      We describe a computational search procedure for automatic detection of
      idiom-candidate phrases in essay texts. The study used a corpus of essays
      written during a standardized examination of English language proficiency.
      Automatically-flagged candidate expressions were manually annotated for
      idiomaticity. The study found that idioms are widely used in EFL essays.
      The study also showed that a search algorithm that accommodates the
      syntactic and lexical exibility of idioms can increase the recall of idiom
      instances by 30%, but it also increases the amount of false positives.

      We propose a new annotated corpus for metaphor interpretation by
      paraphrase, and a novel DNN model for performing this task. Our corpus
      consists of 200 sets of 5 sentences, with each set containing one
      reference metaphorical sentence, and four ranked candidate paraphrases.
      Our model is trained for a binary classification of paraphrase candidates,
      and then used to predict graded paraphrase acceptability. It reaches an
      encouraging 75\% accuracy on the binary classification task, and high
      Pearson (.75) and Spearman (.68) correlations on the gradient judgment
      prediction task.

      As the community working on computational approaches to figurative
      language is growing and as methods and data become increasingly diverse,
      it is important to create widely shared empirical knowledge of the level
      of system performance in a range of contexts, thus facilitating progress
      in this area. One way of creating such shared knowledge is through
      benchmarking multiple systems on a common dataset. We report on the shared
      task on metaphor identification on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus
      conducted at the NAACL 2018 Workshop on Figurative Language Processing.

      Automatic processing of figurative languages is gaining popularity in NLP
      community for their ubiquitous nature and increasing volume. In this era
      of web 2.0, automatic analysis of sarcasm and metaphors is important for
      their extensive usage. Metaphors are a part of figurative language that
      compares different concepts, often on a cognitive level. Many approaches
      have been proposed for automatic detection of metaphors, even using
      sequential models or neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method
      for detection of metaphors at the token level using a hybrid model of
      Bidirectional-LSTM and CRF. We used fewer features, as compared to the
      previous state-of-the-art sequential model. On experimentation with VUAMC,
      our method obtained an F-score of 0.674.

      Metaphor is a popular figure of speech. Popularity of metaphors calls for
      their automatic identification and interpretation. Most of the
      unsupervised methods directed at detection of metaphors use some
      hand-coded knowledge. We propose an unsupervised framework for metaphor
      detection that does not require any hand-coded knowledge. We applied
      clustering on features derived from Adjective-Noun pairs for classifying
      them into two disjoint classes. We experimented with adjective-noun pairs
      of a popular dataset annotated for metaphors and obtained an accuracy of
      72.87% with k-means clustering algorithm.

    <abstract>
      Metaphor is an essential element of human cognition which is often used to
      express ideas and emotions that might be difficult to express using
      literal language. Processing metaphoric language is a challenging task for
      a wide range of applications ranging from text simplification to
      psychotherapy. Despite the variety of approaches that are trying to
      process metaphor, there is still a need for better models that mimic the
      human cognition while exploiting fewer resources. In this paper, we
      present an approach based on distributional semantics to identify
      metaphors on the phrase-level. We investigated the use of different word
      embeddings models to identify verb-noun pairs where the verb is used
      metaphorically. Several experiments are conducted to show the performance
      of the proposed approach on benchmark datasets.

      The current study seeks to implement a deep learning classification
      algorithm us- ing argument-structure level representation of metaphoric
      constructions, for the identifica- tion of source domain mappings in
      metaphoric utterances. It thus builds on previous work in computational
      metaphor interpretation (Mohler et al. 2014; Shutova 2010; Bolle-gala
      and Shutova 2013; Hong 2016; Su et al. 2017) while implementing a
      theoretical frame- work based off of work in the interface of metaphor and
      construction grammar (Sullivan 2006, 2007, 2013). The results indicate
      that it is possible to achieve an accuracy of approx- imately 80.4% using
      the proposed method, combining construction grammatical features with a
      simple deep learning NN. I attribute this increase in accuracy to the use
      of con- structional cues, extracted from the raw text of metaphoric
      instances.

      Metaphors are figurative languages widely used in daily life and
      literatures. It’s an important task to detect the metaphors evoked by
      texts. Thus, the metaphor shared task is aimed to extract metaphors from
      plain texts at word level. We propose to use a CNN-LSTM model for this
      task. Our model combines CNN and LSTM layers to utilize both local and
      long-range contextual information for identifying metaphorical
      information. In addition, we compare the performance of the softmax
      classifier and conditional random field (CRF) for sequential labeling in
      this task. We also incorporated some additional features such as part of
      speech (POS) tags and word cluster to improve the performance of model.
      Our best model achieved 65.06% F-score in the all POS testing subtask and
      67.15% in the verbs testing subtask.

      The contrast between the contextual and general meaning of a word serves
      as an important clue for detecting its metaphoricity. In this paper, we
      present a deep neural architecture for metaphor detection which exploits
      this contrast. Additionally, we also use cost-sensitive learning by
      re-weighting examples, and baseline features like concreteness ratings,

      achieves an overall F1 score of 0.570 on All POS category and 0.605 on the

      The paper addresses detection of figurative usage of words in English
      text. The chosen method was to use neural nets fed by pretrained word
      embeddings. The obtained results show that simple solutions, based on
      words embeddings only, are comparable to complex solutions, using many
      sources of information which are not available for languages less-studied

      This paper describes multiple solutions designed and tested for the
      problem of word-level metaphor detection. The proposed systems are all
      based on variants of recurrent neural network architectures. Specifically,
      we explore multiple sources of information: pre-trained word embeddings
      (Glove), a dictionary of language concreteness and a transfer learning
      scenario based on the states of an encoder network from neural network
      machine translation system. One of the architectures is based on combining
      all three systems: (1) Neural CRF (Conditional Random Fields), trained
      directly on the metaphor data set; (2) Neural Machine Translation encoder
      of a transfer learning scenario; (3) a neural network used to predict
      final labels, trained directly on the metaphor data set. Our results vary
      between test sets: Neural CRF standalone is the best one on submission
      data, while combined system scores the highest on a test subset randomly
      selected from training data.

      at the 16th annual conference of the North American Chapter of the

      a small assertion of trending techniques, which implement matured methods
      from NLP and ML; in particular, the system uses word embeddings from

      In this paper, we investigate the tendency of end-to-end neural Machine
      Reading Comprehension (MRC) models to match shallow patterns rather than
      perform inference-oriented reasoning on RC benchmarks. We aim to test the
      ability of these systems to answer questions which focus on referential
      inference. We propose ParallelQA, a strategy to formulate such questions
      using parallel passages. We also demonstrate that existing neural models
      fail to generalize well to this setting.

      Commonsense knowledge bases such as ConceptNet represent knowledge in the
      form of relational triples. Inspired by recent work by Li et al., we
      analyse if knowledge base completion models can be used to mine
      commonsense knowledge from raw text. We propose novelty of predicted
      triples with respect to the training set as an important factor in
      interpreting results. We critically analyse the difficulty of mining novel
      commonsense knowledge, and show that a simple baseline method that
      outperforms the previous state of the art on predicting more novel
      triples.

    <abstract>
      Seq2Seq based neural architectures have become the go-to architecture to
      apply to sequence to sequence language tasks. Despite their excellent
      performance on these tasks, recent work has noted that these models
      typically do not fully capture the linguistic structure required to
      generalize beyond the dense sections of the data distribution
      ettinger2017towards, and as such, are likely to fail on examples from the
      tail end of the distribution (such as inputs that are noisy
      belkinovnmtbreak, or of different length bentivoglinmtlength). In this
      paper we look at a model’s ability to generalize on a simple symbol
      rewriting task with a clearly defined structure. We find that the model’s
      ability to generalize this structure beyond the training distribution
      depends greatly on the chosen random seed, even when performance on the
      test set remains the same. This finding suggests that model’s ability to
      capture generalizable structure is highly sensitive, and more so, this
      sensitivity may not be apparent when evaluating the model on standard test
      sets.

    <abstract>
      Most scholarly works in the field of computational detection of humour
      derive their inspiration from the incongruity theory. Incongruity is an
      indispensable facet in drawing a line between humorous and non-humorous
      occurrences but is immensely inadequate in shedding light on what actually
      made the particular occurrence a funny one. Classical theories like
      Script-based Semantic Theory of Humour and General Verbal Theory of Humour
      try and achieve this feat to an adequate extent. In this paper we adhere
      to a more holistic approach towards classification of humour based on
      these classical theories with a few improvements and revisions. Through
      experiments based on our linear approach and performed on large data-sets
      of jokes, we are able to demonstrate the adaptability and show
      componentizability of our model, and that a host of classification
      techniques can be used to overcome the challenging problem of
      distinguishing between various categories and sub-categories of jokes.

    <abstract>
      Social media text is replete with unusual capitalization patterns. We
      posit that capitalizing a token like THIS performs two expressive
      functions: it marks a person socially, and marks certain parts of an
      utterance as more salient than others. Focusing on gender and sentiment,
      we illustrate using a corpus of tweets that capitalization appears in more
      negative than positive contexts, and is used more by females compared to
      males. Yet we find that both genders use capitalization in a similar way
      when expressing sentiment.

      This paper describes the creation and annotation of a dataset consisting

      Appraisal features. This is one of the most influential linguistic
      frameworks for the analysis of evaluation and opinion in discourse due to

      applied in NLP in spite of its potential for the classification of the
      subjective content of these reviews. We describe the dataset, the
      annotation scheme and guidelines, the agreement studies, the annotation
      results and their impact on the characterisation of this genre.

      The computational treatment of emotion in natural language text remains
      relatively limited, and Arabic is no exception. This is partly due to lack
      of labeled data. In this work, we describe and manually validate a method
      for the automatic acquisition of emotion labeled data and introduce a
      newly developed data set for Modern Standard and Dialectal Arabic emotion
      detection focused at Robert Plutchik’s 8 basic emotion types. Using a
      hybrid supervision method that exploits first person emotion seeds, we
      show how we can acquire promising results with a deep gated recurrent
      neural network. Our best model reaches 70% F-score, significantly (i.e.,
      11%, p 0:05) outperforming a competitive baseline. Applying our method and
      data on an external dataset of 4 emotions released around the same time we
      finalized our work, we acquire 7% absolute gain in F-score over a linear
      SVM classifier trained on gold data, thus validating our approach.

      Hate speech detection in social media texts is an important Natural
      language Processing task, which has several crucial applications like
      sentiment analysis, investigating cyberbullying and examining
      socio-political controversies. While relevant research has been done
      independently on code-mixed social media texts and hate speech detection,
      our work is the first attempt in detecting hate speech in Hindi-English
      code-mixed social media text. In this paper, we analyze the problem of
      hate speech detection in code-mixed texts and present a Hindi-English
      code-mixed dataset consisting of tweets posted online on Twitter. The
      tweets are annotated with the language at word level and the class they
      belong to (Hate Speech or Normal Speech). We also propose a supervised
      classification system for detecting hate speech in the text using various
      character level, word level, and lexicon based features.

    <abstract>
      Over the years, natural language processing has increasingly focused on
      tasks that can be solved by statistical models, but ignored the social
      aspects of language. These limitations are in large part due to
      historically available data and the limitations of the models, but have
      narrowed our focus and biased the tools demographically. However, with the
      increased availability of data sets including socio-demographic
      information and more expressive (neural) models, we have the opportunity
      to address both issues. I argue that this combination can broaden the
      focus of NLP to solve a whole new range of tasks, enable us to generate
      novel linguistic insights, and provide fairer tools for everyone.

      Twitter is a ubiquitous source of micro-blog social media data, providing
      the academic, industrial, and public sectors real-time access to
      actionable information. A particularly attractive property of some tweets
      is *geo-tagging*, where a user account has opted-in to attaching their
      current location to each message. Unfortunately (from a researcher’s
      perspective) only a fraction of Twitter accounts agree to this, and these
      accounts are likely to have systematic diffences with the general
      population. This work is an exploratory study of these differences across
      the full range of Twitter content, and complements previous studies that
      focus on the English-language subset. Additionally, we compare methods for
      querying users by self-identified properties, finding that the constrained
      semantics of the "description" field provides cleaner, higher-volume
      results than more complex regular expressions.

      Twitter user accounts include a range of different user types. While many
      individuals use Twitter, organizations also have Twitter accounts.
      Identifying opinions and trends from Twitter requires the accurate
      differentiation of these two groups. Previous work (McCorriston et al.,
      2015) presented a method for determining if an account was an individual
      or organization based on account profile and a collection of tweets. We
      present a method that relies solely on the account profile, allowing for
      the classification of individuals versus organizations based on a single
      tweet. Our method obtains accuracies comparable to methods that rely on
      much more information by leveraging two improvements: a character-based
      Convolutional Neural Network, and an automatically derived labeled corpus
      an order of magnitude larger than the previously available dataset. We
      make both the dataset and the resulting tool available.

      The paper provides an outline of the scope for synergy between
      computational linguistic analysis and population stud-ies. It first
      reviews where population studies stand in terms of using social media
      data. Demographers are entering the realm of big data in force. But, this
      paper argues, population studies have much to gain from computational
      linguis-tic analysis, especially in terms of ex-plaining the drivers
      behind population processes. The paper gives two examples of how the
      method can be applied, and concludes with a fundamental caveat. Yes,
      computational linguistic analysis provides a possible key for integrating
      micro theory into any demographic analysis of social media data. But
      results may be of little value in as much as knowledge about fundamental
      sample characteristics are unknown.

      In this paper, we focus on understanding linguistic differences across
      groups with different self-identified gender and stance in expressing
      opinions about ABORTION. We provide a new dataset consisting of users’
      gender, stance on ABORTION as well as the debates in ABOR- TION drawn from
      debate.org. We use the gender and stance information to identify
      significant linguistic differences across individuals with different
      gender and stance. We show the importance of considering the stance
      information along with the gender since we observe significant linguistic
      differences across individuals with different stance even within the same
      gender group.

      Email conversations are the primary mode of communication in enterprises.
      The email content expresses an individual’s needs, requirements and
      intentions. Affective information in the email text can be used to get an
      insight into the sender’s mood or emotion. We present a novel approach to
      model human frustration in text. We identify linguistic features that
      influence human perception of frustration and model it as a supervised
      learning task. The paper provides a detailed comparison across traditional
      regression and word distribution-based models. We report a mean-squared
      error (MSE) of 0.018 against human-annotated frustration for the best
      performing model. The approach establishes the importance of affect
      features in frustration prediction for email data. We further evaluate the
      efficacy of the proposed feature set and model in predicting other tone or
      affects in text, namely formality and politeness; results demonstrate a
      comparable performance against the state-of-the-art baselines.

      Automated personality prediction from social media is gaining increasing
      attention in natural language processing and social sciences communities.
      However, due to high labeling costs and privacy issues, the few publicly
      available datasets are of limited size and low topic diversity. We address
      this problem by introducing a large-scale dataset derived from Reddit, a
      source so far overlooked for personality prediction. The dataset is
      labeled with Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTI) and comes with a rich set
      of features for more than 9k users. We carry out a preliminary feature
      analysis, revealing marked differences between the MBTI dimensions and
      poles. Furthermore, we use the dataset to train and evaluate benchmark
      personality prediction models, achieving macro F1-scores between 67% and
      82% on the individual dimensions and 82% accuracy for exact or one-off
      accurate type prediction. These results are encouraging and comparable
      with the reliability of standardized tests.

      Written text transmits a good deal of nonverbal information related to the
      author’s identity and social factors, such as age, gender and personality.
      However, it is less known to what extent behavioral biometric traces
      transmit such information. We use typist data to study the predictiveness
      of authorship, and present first experiments on predicting both age and
      gender from keystroke dynamics. Our results show that the model based on
      keystroke features, while being two orders of magnitude smaller, leads to
      significantly higher accuracies for authorship than the text-based system.
      For user attribute prediction, the best approach is to combine the two,
      suggesting that extralinguistic factors are disclosed to a larger degree
      in written text, while author identity is better transmitted in typing
      behavior.

    <abstract>
      Recent studies in the field of text-based personality recognition
      experiment with different languages, feature extraction techniques, and
      machine learning algorithms to create better and more accurate models;
      however, little focus is placed on exploring the language use of a group
      of individuals defined by nationality. Individuals of the same nationality
      share certain practices and communicate certain ideas that can become
      embedded into their natural language. Many nationals are also not limited
      to speaking just one language, such as how Filipinos speak Filipino and
      English, the two national languages of the Philippines. The addition of
      several regional/indigenous languages, along with the commonness of
      code-switching, allow for a Filipino to have a rich vocabulary. This
      presents an opportunity to create a text-based personality model based on
      how Filipinos speak, regardless of the language they use. To do so, data
      was collected from 250 Filipino Twitter users. Different combinations of
      data processing techniques were experimented upon to create personality
      models for each of the Big Five. The results for both regression and
      classification show that Conscientiousness is consistently the easiest
      trait to model, followed by Extraversion. Classification models for
      Agreeableness and Neuroticism had subpar performances, but performed
      better than those of Openness. An analysis on personality trait score
      representation showed that classifying extreme outliers generally produce
      better results for all traits except for Neuroticism and Openness.

    <abstract>
      Neural machine translation has achieved impressive results in the last few
      years, but its success has been limited to settings with large amounts of
      parallel data. One way to improve NMT for lower-resource settings is to
      initialize a word-based NMT model with pretrained word embeddings.
      However, rare words still suffer from lower quality word embeddings when
      trained with standard word-level objectives. We introduce word embeddings
      that utilize morphological resources, and compare to purely unsupervised
      alternatives. We work with Arabic, a morphologically rich language with
      available linguistic resources, and perform Ar-to-En MT experiments on a
      small corpus of TED subtitles. We find that word embeddings utilizing
      subword information consistently outperform standard word embeddings on a
      word similarity task and as initialization of the source word embeddings
      in a low-resource NMT system.

      Recent literature has shown a wide variety of benefits to mapping
      traditional one-hot representations of words and phrases to
      lower-dimensional real-valued vectors known as word embeddings.
      Traditionally, most word embedding algorithms treat each word as the
      finest meaningful semantic granularity and perform embedding by learning
      distinct embedding vectors for each word. Contrary to this line of
      thought, technical domains such as scientific and medical literature
      compose words from subword structures such as prefixes, suffixes, and
      root-words as well as compound words. Treating individual words as the
      finest-granularity unit discards meaningful shared semantic structure
      between words sharing substructures. This not only leads to poor
      embeddings for text corpora that have long-tail distributions, but also
      heuristic methods for handling out-of-vocabulary words. In this paper we
      propose SubwordMine, an entropy-based subword mining algorithm that is
      fast, unsupervised, and fully data-driven. We show that this allows for
      great cross-domain performance in identifying semantically meaningful
      subwords. We then investigate utilizing the mined subwords within the
      FastText embedding model and compare performance of the learned
      representations in a downstream language modeling task.

      This paper seeks to examine the effect of including background knowledge
      in the form of character pre-trained neural language model (LM), and data
      bootstrapping to overcome the problem of unbalanced limited resources. As
      a test, we explore the task of language identification in mixed-language
      short non-edited texts with an under-resourced language, namely the case
      of Algerian Arabic for which both labelled and unlabelled data are
      limited. We compare the performance of two traditional machine learning
      methods and a deep neural networks (DNNs) model. The results show that
      overall DNNs perform better on labelled data for the majority categories
      and struggle with the minority ones. While the effect of the untokenised
      and unlabelled data encoded as LM differs for each category,
      bootstrapping, however, improves the performance of all systems and all
      categories. These methods are language independent and could be
      generalised to other under-resourced languages for which a small labelled
      data and a larger unlabelled data are available.

      Most modern approaches to computing word embeddings assume the
      availability of text corpora with billions of words. In this paper, we
      explore a setup where only corpora with millions of words are available,
      and many words in any new text are out of vocabulary. This setup is both
      of practical interests – modeling the situation for specific domains and
      low-resource languages – and of psycholinguistic interest, since it
      corresponds much more closely to the actual experiences and challenges of
      human language learning and use. We compare standard skip-gram word
      embeddings with character-based embeddings on word relatedness prediction.
      Skip-grams excel on large corpora, while character-based embeddings do
      well on small corpora generally and rare and complex words specifically.
      The models can be combined easily.

      Subword-level information is crucial for capturing the meaning and
      morphology of words, especially for out-of-vocabulary entries. We propose
      CNN- and RNN-based subword-level composition functions for learning word
      embeddings, and systematically compare them with popular word-level and
      subword-level models (Skip-Gram and FastText). Additionally, we propose a
      hybrid training scheme in which a pure subword-level model is trained
      jointly with a conventional word-level embedding model based on
      lookup-tables. This increases the fitness of all types of subword-level
      word embeddings; the word-level embeddings can be discarded after
      training, leaving only compact subword-level representation with much
      smaller data volume. We evaluate these embeddings on a set of intrinsic
      and extrinsic tasks, showing that subword-level models have advantage on
      tasks related to morphology and datasets with high OOV rate, and can be
      combined with other types of embeddings.

      We introduce a simple method for extracting non-arbitrary form-meaning
      representations from a collection of semantic vectors. We treat the
      problem as one of feature selection for a model trained to predict word
      vectors from subword features. We apply this model to the problem of
      automatically discovering phonesthemes, which are submorphemic sound
      clusters that appear in words with similar meaning. Many of our
      model-predicted phonesthemes overlap with those proposed in the
      linguistics literature, and we validate our approach with human judgments.

      We explore the use of two independent subsystems Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)
      and Morfessor as basic units for subword-level neural machine translation
      (NMT). We show that, for linguistically distant language-pairs
      Morfessor-based segmentation algorithm produces significantly better
      quality translation than BPE. However, for close language-pairs BPE-based
      subword-NMT may translate better than Morfessor-based subword-NMT. We
      propose a combined approach of these two segmentation algorithms
      Morfessor-BPE (M-BPE) which outperforms these two baseline systems in
      terms of BLEU score. Our results are supported by experiments on three
      language-pairs: English-Hindi, Bengali-Hindi and English-Bengali.

    <abstract>
      We present early results from a system under development which uses
      sub-word embeddings for query expansion in presence of mis-spelled words
      and other aberrations. We work for a company which creates accounting
      software and the end goal is to improve customer experience when they
      search for help on our "Customer Care" portal. Our customers use
      colloquial language, non-standard acronyms and sometimes mis-spell words
      when they use our Search portal or interact over other channels. However,
      our Knowledge Base has curated content which leverages technical terms and
      is in language which is quite formal. This results in the answer not being
      retrieved even though the answer might actually be present in the
      documentation (as assessed by a human). We address this problem by
      creating equivalence classes of words with similar meanings (with the
      additional property that the mappings to these equivalence classes are
      robust to mis-spellings) using sub-word embeddings and then use them to
      fine tune an Elasticsearch index to improve recall. We demonstrate through
      an end-end system that using sub-word embeddings leads to a significant
      lift in correct answers retrieved for an accounting corpus available in
      the public domain.

      Brain-computer interfaces and other augmentative and alternative
      communication devices introduce language-modeing challenges distinct from
      other character-entry methods. In particular, the acquired signal of the
      EEG (electroencephalogram) signal is noisier, which, in turn, makes the
      user intent harder to decipher. In order to adapt to this condition, we
      propose to maintain ambiguous history for every time step, and to employ,
      apart from the character language model, word information to produce a
      more robust prediction system. We present preliminary results that compare
      this proposed Online-Context Language Model (OCLM) to current algorithms
      that are used in this type of setting. Evaluation on both perplexity and
      predictive accuracy demonstrates promising results when dealing with
      ambiguous histories in order to provide to the front end a distribution of
      the next character the user might type.

    <abstract>
      Currently, news articles are produced, shared and consumed at an extremely
      rapid rate. Although their quantity is increasing, at the same time, their
      quality and trustworthiness is becoming fuzzier. Hence, it is important
      not only to automate information extraction but also to quantify the
      certainty of this information. Automated identification of certainty has
      been studied both in the scientific and newswire domains, but performance
      is considerably higher in tasks focusing on scientific text. We compare
      the differences in the definition and expression of uncertainty between a
      scientific domain, i.e., biomedicine, and newswire. We delve into the
      different aspects that affect the certainty of an extracted event in a
      news article and examine whether they can be easily identified by
      techniques already validated in the biomedical domain. Finally, we present
      a comparison of the syntactic and lexical differences between the the
      expression of certainty in the biomedical and newswire domains, using two
      annotated corpora.

      This paper describes the first version of an open-source semantic parser
      that creates graphical representations of sentences to be used for further
      semantic processing, e.g. for natural language inference, reasoning and
      semantic similarity. The Graphical Knowledge Representation which is
      output by the parser is inspired by the Abstract Knowledge Representation,
      which separates out conceptual and contextual levels of representation
      that deal respectively with the subject matter of a sentence and its
      existential commitments. Our representation is a layered graph with each
      sub-graph holding different kinds of information, including one sub-graph
      for concepts and one for contexts. Our first evaluation of the system
      shows an F-score of 85% in accurately representing sentences as semantic
      graphs.

    <abstract>
      The classical view on argumentation, such that arguments are logical
      structures consisting of different distinguishable parts and that parties
      exchange arguments in a rational way, is prevalent in textbooks but
      nonexistent in the real world. Instead, argumentation is a multifaceted
      communication tool built upon humans’ capabilities to easily use common
      sense, emotions, and social context. As humans, we are pretty good at it.
      Computational Argumentation tries to tackle these phenomena but has a long
      and not so easy way to go. In this talk, I would like to shed a light on
      several recent attempts to deal with argumentation computationally, such
      as addressing argument quality, understanding argument reasoning, dealing
      with fallacies, and how should we never ever argue online.

    <abstract>
      The challenge for computational models of spatial descriptions for
      situated dialogue systems is the integration of information from different
      modalities. The semantics of spatial descriptions are grounded in at least
      two sources of information: (i) a geometric representation of space and
      (ii) the functional interaction of related objects that. We train several
      neural language models on descriptions of scenes from a dataset of image
      captions and examine whether the functional or geometric bias of spatial
      descriptions reported in the literature is reflected in the estimated
      perplexity of these models. The results of these experiments have
      implications for the creation of models of spatial lexical semantics for
      human-robot dialogue systems. Furthermore, they also provide an insight
      into the kinds of the semantic knowledge captured by neural language
      models trained on spatial descriptions, which has implications for image
      captioning systems.

      We demonstrate a system for understanding natural language utterances for
      structure description and placement in a situated blocks world context. By
      relying on a rich, domain-specific adaptation of a generic ontology and a
      logical form structure produced by a semantic parser, we obviate the need
      for an intermediate, domain-specific representation and can produce a
      reasoner that grounds and reasons over concepts and constraints with
      real-valued data. This linguistic base enables more flexibility in
      interpreting natural language expressions invoking intrinsic concepts and
      features of structures and space. We demonstrate some of the capabilities
      of a system grounded in deep language understanding and present initial
      results in a structure learning task.

    <abstract>
      Developing computational models of spatial prepositions (such as on, in,
      above, etc.) is crucial for such tasks as human-machine collaboration,
      story understanding, and 3D model generation from descriptions. However,
      these prepositions are notoriously vague and ambiguous, with meanings
      depending on the types, shapes and sizes of entities in the argument
      positions, the physical and task context, and other factors. As a result
      truth value judgments for prepositional relations are often uncertain and
      variable. In this paper we treat the modeling task as calling for
      assignment of probabilities to such relations as a function of multiple
      factors, where such probabilities can be viewed as estimates of whether
      humans would judge the relations to hold in given circumstances. We
      implemented our models in a 3D blocks world and a room world in a computer
      graphics setting, and found that true/false judgments based on these
      models do not differ much more from human judgments that the latter differ
      from one another. However, what really matters pragmatically is not the
      accuracy of truth value judgments but whether, for instance, the computer
      models suffice for identifying objects described in terms of prepositional
      relations, (e.g., "the box to the left of the table", where there are
      multiple boxes). For such tasks, our models achieved accuracies above 90%
      for most relations.

    <abstract>
      Prior methodologies for understanding spatial language have treated
      literal expressions such as "Mary pushed the car over the edge"
      differently from metaphorical extensions such as "Mary’s job pushed her
      over the edge". We demonstrate a methodology for standardizing literal and
      metaphorical meanings, by building on work in Lexical Conceptual Structure
      (LCS), a general-purpose representational component used in machine
      translation. We argue that spatial predicates naturally extend into other
      fields (e.g., circumstantial or temporal), and that LCS provides both a
      framework for distinguishing spatial from non-spatial, and a system for
      finding metaphorical meaning extensions. We start with MetaNet (MN), a
      large repository of conceptual metaphors, condensing 197 spatial entries
      into sixteen top-level categories of motion frames. Using naturally
      occurring instances of English push , and expansions of MN frames, we
      demonstrate that literal and metaphorical extensions exhibit patterns
      predicted and represented by the LCS model.

      While humans use natural language to express spatial relations between and

      have a facility that depends on that human facility. This position paper
      presents approach to representing spatial relations in language, and

      This work shows the importance of axis-orientation systems for capturing

      Spatial language understanding is important for practical applications and
      as a building block for better abstract language understanding. Much
      progress has been made through work on understanding spatial relations and
      values in images and texts as well as on giving and following navigation
      instructions in restricted domains. We argue that the next big advances in
      spatial language understanding can be best supported by creating
      large-scale datasets that focus on points and paths based in the real
      world, and then extending these to create online, persistent playscapes
      that mix human and bot players, where the bot players must learn, evolve,
      and survive according to their depth of understanding of scenes,
      navigation, and interactions.

      Spatial relation extraction from generic text is a challenging problem due
      to the ambiguity of the prepositions spatial meaning as well as the
      nesting structure of the spatial descriptions. In this work, we highlight
      the difficulties that the anaphora can make in the extraction of spatial
      relations. We use external multi-modal (here visual) resources to find the
      most probable candidates for resolving the anaphoras that refer to the
      landmarks of the spatial relations. We then use global inference to decide
      jointly on resolving the anaphora and extraction of the spatial relations.
      Our preliminary results show that resolving anaphora improves the
      state-of-the-art results on spatial relation extraction.

      This position paper argues that, while prior work in spatial language
      understanding for tasks such as robot navigation focuses on mapping
      natural language into deep conceptual or non-linguistic representations,
      it is possible to systematically derive regular patterns of spatial
      language usage from existing lexical-semantic resources. Furthermore, even
      with access to such resources, effective solutions to many application
      areas such as robot navigation and narrative generation also require
      additional knowledge at the syntax-semantics interface to cover the wide
      range of spatial expressions observed and available to natural language
      speakers. We ground our insights in, and present our extensions to, an
      existing lexico-semantic resource, covering 500 semantic classes of verbs,
      of which 219 fall within a spatial subset. We demonstrate that these
      extensions enable systematic derivation of regular patterns of spatial
      language without requiring manual annotation.

      In this opinion piece, we argue that there is a need for alternative
      design directions to complement existing AI efforts in narrative and
      character generation and algorithm development. To make our argument, we
      a) outline the predominant roles and goals of AI research in storytelling;
      b) present existing discourse on the benefits and harms of narratives; and
      c) highlight the pain points in character creation revealed by
      semi-structured interviews we conducted with 14 individuals deeply
      involved in some form of character creation. We conclude by proffering
      several specific design avenues that we believe can seed fruitful research
      collaborations. In our vision, AI collaborates with humans during creative
      processes and narrative generation, helps amplify voices and perspectives
      that are currently marginalized or misrepresented, and engenders
      experiences of narrative that support spectatorship and listening roles.

      We examine an emerging NLP application that supports creative writing by
      automatically suggesting continuing sentences in a story. The application
      tracks users’ modifications to generated sentences, which can be used to
      quantify their "helpfulness" in advancing the story. We explore the task
      of predicting helpfulness based on automatically detected linguistic
      features of the suggestions. We illustrate this analysis on a set of user
      interactions with the application using an initial selection of features
      relevant to story generation.

    <abstract>
      Computational visual storytelling produces a textual description of events
      and interpretations depicted in a sequence of images. These texts are made
      possible by advances and cross-disciplinary approaches in natural language
      processing, generation, and computer vision. We define a computational
      creative visual storytelling as one with the ability to alter the telling
      of a story along three aspects: to speak about different environments, to
      produce variations based on narrative goals, and to adapt the narrative to
      the audience. These aspects of creative storytelling and their effect on
      the narrative have yet to be explored in visual storytelling. This paper
      presents a pipeline of task-modules, Object Identification, Single-Image
      Inferencing, and Multi-Image Narration, that serve as a preliminary design
      for building a creative visual storyteller. We have piloted this design
      for a sequence of images in an annotation task. We present and analyze the
      collected corpus and describe plans towards automation.

      Soundtracks play an important role in carrying the story of a film. In
      this work, we collect a corpus of movies and television shows matched with
      subtitles and soundtracks and analyze the relationship between story,
      song, and audience reception. We look at the content of a film through the
      lens of its latent topics and at the content of a song through descriptors
      of its musical attributes. In two experiments, we find first that
      individual topics are strongly associated with musical attributes, and
      second, that musical attributes of soundtracks are predictive of film
      ratings, even after controlling for topic and genre.

      We present a general framework of analyzing existing story corpora to
      generate controllable and creative new stories. The proposed framework
      needs little manual annotation to achieve controllable story generation.
      It creates a new interface for humans to interact with computers to
      generate personalized stories. We apply the framework to build recurrent
      neural network (RNN)-based generation models to control story ending
      valence and storyline. Experiments show that our methods successfully
      achieve the control and enhance the coherence of stories through
      introducing storylines. with additional control factors, the generation
      model gets lower perplexity, and yields more coherent stories that are
      faithful to the control factors according to human evaluation.

    <abstract>
      We address the task of predicting causally related events in stories
      according to a standard evaluation framework, the Choice of Plausible
      Alternatives (COPA). We present a neural encoder-decoder model that learns
      to predict relations between adjacent sequences in stories as a means of
      modeling causality. We explore this approach using different methods for
      extracting and representing sequence pairs as well as different model
      architectures. We also compare the impact of different training datasets
      on our model. In particular, we demonstrate the usefulness of a corpus not
      previously applied to COPA, the ROCStories corpus. While not
      state-of-the-art, our results establish a new reference point for systems
      evaluated on COPA, and one that is particularly informative for future
      neural-based approaches.

      We present a novel approach for event extraction and abstraction from
      movie descriptions. Our event frame consists of ‘who”, “did what” “to
      whom”, “where”, and “when”. We formulate our problem using a recurrent
      neural network, enhanced with structural features extracted from syntactic
      parser, and trained using curriculum learning by progressively increasing
      the difficulty of the sentences. Our model serves as an intermediate step
      towards question answering systems, visual storytelling, and story
      completion tasks. We evaluate our approach on MovieQA dataset.

      We present an approach to detect stylistic variation across social
      variables (here: gender and social class), considering also diachronic
      change in language use. For detection of stylistic variation, we use
      relative entropy, measuring the difference between probability
      distributions at different linguistic levels (here: lexis and grammar). In
      addition, by relative entropy, we can determine which linguistic units are
      related to stylistic variation.

    <abstract>
      Social media features substantial stylistic variation, raising new
      challenges for syntactic analysis of online writing. However, this
      variation is often aligned with author attributes such as age, gender, and
      geography, as well as more readily-available social network metadata. In
      this paper, we report new evidence on the link between language and social
      networks in the task of part-of-speech tagging. We find that tagger error
      rates are correlated with network structure, with high accuracy in some
      parts of the network, and lower accuracy elsewhere. As a result, tagger
      accuracy depends on training from a balanced sample of the network, rather
      than training on texts from a narrow subcommunity. We also describe our
      attempts to add robustness to stylistic variation, by building a
      mixture-of-experts model in which each expert is associated with a region
      of the social network. While prior work found that similar approaches
      yield performance improvements in sentiment analysis and entity linking,
      we were unable to obtain performance improvements in part-of-speech
      tagging, despite strong evidence for the link between part-of-speech error
      rates and social network structure.

    <abstract>
      We present a machine learning approach to distinguish texts translated to
      Chinese (by humans) from texts originally written in Chinese, with a focus
      on a wide range of syntactic features. Using Support Vector Machines
      (SVMs) as classifier on a genre-balanced corpus in translation studies of
      Chinese, we find that constituent parse trees and dependency triples as
      features without lexical information perform very well on the task, with
      an F-measure above 90%, close to the results of lexical n-gram features,
      without the risk of learning topic information rather than translation
      features. Thus, we claim syntactic features alone can accurately
      distinguish translated from original Chinese. Translated Chinese exhibits
      an increased use of determiners, subject position pronouns, NP + "的" as NP
      modifiers, multiple NPs or VPs conjoined by "、", among other structures.
      We also interpret the syntactic features with reference to previous
      translation studies in Chinese, particularly the usage of pronouns.

    <abstract>
      Language generation tasks that seek to mimic human ability to use language
      creatively are difficult to evaluate, since one must consider creativity,
      style, and other non-trivial aspects of the generated text. The goal of
      this paper is to develop evaluations methods for one such task,
      ghostwriting of rap lyrics, and to provide an explicit, quantifiable
      foundation for the goals and future directions for this task. Ghostwriting
      must produce text that is similar in style to the emulated artist, yet
      distinct in content. We develop a novel evaluation methodology that
      addresses several complementary aspects of this task, and illustrate how
      such evaluation can be used to meaning fully analyze system performance.
      We provide a corpus of lyrics for 13 rap artists, annotated for stylistic
      similarity, which allows us to assess the feasibility of manual evaluation
      for generated verse.

      In this paper, we approach the task of native language identification in a
      realistic cross-corpus scenario where a model is trained with available
      data and has to predict the native language from data of a different
      corpus. The motivation behind this study is to investigate native language
      identification in the Australian academic scenario where a majority of
      students come from China, Indonesia, and Arabic-speaking nations. We have
      proposed a statistical embedding representation reporting a significant
      improvement over common single-layer approaches of the state of the art,
      identifying Chinese, Arabic, and Indonesian in a cross-corpus scenario.
      The proposed approach was shown to be competitive even when the data is
      scarce and imbalanced.

      We introduce a machine learning approach for the identification of “white
      spaces” in scientific knowledge. Our approach addresses this task as link
      prediction over a graph that contains over 2M influence statements such as
      “CTCF activates FOXA1”, which were automatically extracted using
      open-domain machine reading. We model this prediction task using
      graph-based features extracted from the above influence graph, as well as
      from a citation graph that captures scientific communities. We evaluated
      the proposed approach through backtesting. Although the data is heavily
      unbalanced (50 times more negative examples than positives), our approach
      predicts which influence links will be discovered in the “near future”
      with a F1 score of 27 points, and a mean average precision of 68%.

      Corpus2graph is an open-source NLP-application-oriented tool that
      generates a word co-occurrence network from a large corpus. It not only
      contains different built-in methods to preprocess words, analyze
      sentences, extract word pairs and define edge weights, but also supports
      user-customized functions. By using parallelization techniques, it can
      generate a large word co-occurrence network of the whole English Wikipedia
      data within hours. And thanks to its nodes-edges-weight three-level
      progressive calculation design, rebuilding networks with different
      configurations is even faster as it does not need to start all over again.
      This tool also works with other graph libraries such as igraph, NetworkX
      and graph-tool as a front end providing data to boost network generation
      speed.

    <abstract>
      Question Answering for complex questions is often modelled as a graph
      construction or traversal task, where a solver must build or traverse a
      graph of facts that answer and explain a given question. This "multi-hop"
      inference has been shown to be extremely challenging, with few models able
      to aggregate more than two facts before being overwhelmed by "semantic
      drift", or the tendency for long chains of facts to quickly drift off
      topic. This is a major barrier to current inference models, as even
      elementary science questions require an average of 4 to 6 facts to answer
      and explain. In this work we empirically characterize the difficulty of
      building or traversing a graph of sentences connected by lexical overlap,
      by evaluating chance sentence aggregation quality through 9,784
      manually-annotated judgements across knowledge graphs built from three
      free-text corpora (including study guides and Simple Wikipedia). We
      demonstrate semantic drift tends to be high and aggregation quality low,
      at between 0.04 and 3, and highlight scenarios that maximize the
      likelihood of meaningfully combining information.

    <abstract>
      Multi-Sentence Compression (MSC) aims to generate a short sentence with
      key information from a cluster of closely related sentences. MSC enables
      summarization and question-answering systems to generate outputs combining
      fully formed sentences from one or several documents. This paper describes
      a new Integer Linear Programming method for MSC using a vertex-labeled
      graph to select different keywords, and novel 3-gram scores to generate
      more informative sentences while maintaining their grammaticality. Our
      system is of good quality and outperforms the state-of-the-art for
      evaluations led on news dataset. We led both automatic and manual
      evaluations to determine the informativeness and the grammaticality of
      compressions for each dataset. Additional tests, which take advantage of
      the fact that the length of compressions can be modulated, still improve
      ROUGE scores with shorter output sentences. Author4Affiliation

    <abstract>
      Spectral clustering has received a lot of attention due to its ability to
      separate nonconvex, non-intersecting manifolds, but its high computational
      complexity has significantly limited its applicability. Motivated by the
      document-term co-clustering framework by Dhillon (2001), we propose a
      landmark-based scalable spectral clustering approach in which we first use
      the selected landmark set and the given data to form a bipartite graph and
      then run a diffusion process on it to obtain a family of diffusion
      coordinates for clustering. We show that our proposed algorithm can be
      implemented based on very efficient operations on the affinity matrix
      between the given data and selected landmarks, thus capable of handling
      large data. Finally, we demonstrate the excellent performance of our
      method by comparing with the state-of-the-art scalable algorithms on
      several benchmark data sets.

    <abstract>
      Word sense induction (WSI), which addresses polysemy by unsupervised
      discovery of multiple word senses, resolves ambiguities for downstream NLP
      tasks and also makes word representations more interpretable. This paper
      proposes an accurate and efficient graph-based method for WSI that builds
      a global non-negative vector embedding basis (which are interpretable like
      topics) and clusters the basis indexes in the ego network of each
      polysemous word. By adopting distributional inclusion vector embeddings as
      our basis formation model, we avoid the expensive step of nearest neighbor
      search that plagues other graph-based methods without sacrificing the
      quality of sense clusters. Experiments on three datasets show that our
      proposed method produces similar or better sense clusters and embeddings
      compared with previous state-of-the-art methods while being significantly
      more efficient.

    <abstract>
      Contrary to the traditional Bag-of-Words approach, we consider the
      Graph-of-Words(GoW) model in which each document is represented by a graph
      that encodes relationships between the different terms. Based on this
      formulation, the importance of a term is determined by weighting the
      corresponding node in the document, collection and label graphs, using
      node centrality criteria. We also introduce novel graph-based weighting
      schemes by enriching graphs with word-embedding similarities, in order to
      reward or penalize semantic relationships. Our methods produce more
      discriminative feature weights for text categorization, outperforming
      existing frequency-based criteria.

    <abstract>
      Natural language text exhibits hierarchical structure in a variety of
      respects. Ideally, we could incorporate our prior knowledge of this
      hierarchical structure into unsupervised learning algorithms that work on
      text data. Recent work by nickel2017poincar proposed using hyperbolic
      instead of Euclidean embedding spaces to represent hierarchical data and
      demonstrated encouraging results when embedding graphs. In this work, we
      extend their method with a re-parameterization technique that allows us to
      learn hyperbolic embeddings of arbitrarily parameterized objects. We apply
      this framework to learn word and sentence embeddings in hyperbolic space
      in an unsupervised manner from text corpora. The resulting embeddings seem
      to encode certain intuitive notions of hierarchy, such as word-context
      frequency and phrase constituency. However, the implicit continuous
      hierarchy in the learned hyperbolic space makes interrogating the model’s
      learned hierarchies more difficult than for models that learn explicit
      edges between items. The learned hyperbolic embeddings show improvements
      over Euclidean embeddings in some – but not all – downstream tasks,
      suggesting that hierarchical organization is more useful for some tasks
      than others.

        <abstract>Functioning is gaining recognition as an important indicator of global health, but remains under-studied in medical natural language processing research. We present the first analysis of automatically extracting descriptions of patient mobility, using a recently-developed dataset of free text electronic health records. We frame the task as a named entity recognition (NER) problem, and investigate the applicability of NER techniques to mobility extraction. As text corpora focused on patient functioning are scarce, we explore domain adaptation of word embeddings for use in a recurrent neural network NER system. We find that embeddings trained on a small in-domain corpus perform nearly as well as those learned from large out-of-domain corpora, and that domain adaptation techniques yield additional improvements in both precision and recall. Our analysis identifies several significant challenges in extracting descriptions of patient mobility, including the length and complexity of annotated entities and high linguistic variability in mobility descriptions.</abstract>

        <abstract>Automatic identification of heart disease risk factors in clinical narratives can expedite disease progression modelling and support clinical decisions. Existing practical solutions for cardiovascular risk detection are mostly hybrid systems entailing the integration of knowledge-driven and data-driven methods, relying on dictionaries, rules and machine learning methods that require a substantial amount of human effort. This paper proposes a comparative analysis on the applicability of deep learning, a re-emerged data-driven technique, in the context of clinical text classification. Various deep learning architectures were devised and evaluated for extracting heart disease risk factors from clinical documents. The data provided for the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth shared task focusing on identifying risk factors for heart disease was used for system development and evaluation. Results have shown that a relatively simple deep learning model can achieve a high micro-averaged F-measure of 0.9081, which is comparable to the best systems from the shared task. This is highly encouraging given the simplicity of the deep learning approach compared to the heavily feature-engineered hybrid approaches that were required to achieve state-of-the-art performances.</abstract>

        <abstract>We propose keyphrases extraction technique to extract important terms from the healthcare user-generated contents. We employ deep learning architecture, i.e. Long Short-Term Memory, and leverage word embeddings, medical concepts from a knowledge base, and linguistic components as our features. The proposed model achieves 61.37\% F-1 score. Experimental results indicate that our proposed approach outperforms the baseline methods, i.e. RAKE and CRF, on the task of extracting keyphrases from Indonesian health forum posts.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a machine learning pipeline that identifies key sentences in abstracts of oncological articles to aid evidence-based medicine. This problem is characterized by the lack of gold standard datasets, data imbalance and thematic differences between available silver standard corpora. Additionally, available training and target data differs with regard to their domain (professional summaries vs. sentences in abstracts). This makes supervised machine learning inapplicable. We propose the use of two semi-supervised machine learning approaches: To mitigate difficulties arising from heterogeneous data sources, overcome data imbalance and create reliable training data we propose using transductive learning from positive and unlabelled data (PU Learning). For obtaining a realistic classification model, we propose the use of abstracts summarised in relevant sentences as unlabelled examples through Self-Training. The best model achieves 84% accuracy and 0.84 F1 score on our dataset</abstract>

        <abstract>Ontology alignment is the task of identifying semantically equivalent entities from two given ontologies. Different ontologies have different representations of the same entity, resulting in a need to de-duplicate entities when merging ontologies. We propose a method for enriching entities in an ontology with external definition and context information, and use this additional information for ontology alignment. We develop a neural architecture capable of encoding the additional information when available, and show that the addition of external data results in an F1-score of 0.69 on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) largebio SNOMED-NCI subtask, comparable with the entity-level matchers in a SOTA system.</abstract>

        <abstract>Word2vec embeddings are limited to computing vectors for in-vocabulary terms and do not take into account sub-word information. Character-based representations, such as fastText, mitigate such limitations. We optimize and compare these representations for the biomedical domain. fastText was found to consistently outperform word2vec in named entity recognition tasks for entities such as chemicals and genes. This is likely due to gained information from computed out-of-vocabulary term vectors, as well as the word compositionality of such entities. Contrastingly, performance varied on intrinsic datasets. Optimal hyper-parameters were intrinsic dataset-dependent, likely due to differences in term types distributions. This indicates embeddings should be chosen based on the task at hand. We therefore provide a number of optimized hyper-parameter sets and pre-trained word2vec and fastText models, available on https://github.com/dterg/bionlp-embed.</abstract>

        <abstract>Successful evidence-based medicine (EBM) applications rely on answering clinical questions by analyzing large medical literature databases. In order to formulate a well-defined, focused clinical question, a framework called PICO is widely used, which identifies the sentences in a given medical text that belong to the four components: Participants/Problem (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). In this work, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network based model to automatically detect PICO elements. By jointly classifying subsequent sentences in the given text, we achieve state-of-the-art results on PICO element classification compared to several strong baseline models. We also make our curated data public as a benchmarking dataset so that the community can benefit from it.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes the COSTA scheme for coding structures and actions in conversation. Informed by Conversation Analysis, the scheme introduces an innovative method for marking multi-layer structural organization of conversation and a structure-informed taxonomy of actions. In addition, we create a corpus of naturally occurring medical conversations, containing 318 video-recorded and manually transcribed pediatric consultations. Based on the annotated corpus, we investigate 1) treatment decision-making process in medical conversations, and 2) effects of physician-caregiver communication behaviors on antibiotic over-prescribing. Although the COSTA annotation scheme is developed based on data from the task-specific domain of pediatric consultations, it can be easily extended to apply to more general domains and other languages.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this study, we investigate learning-to-rank and query refinement approaches for information retrieval in the pharmacogenomic domain. The goal is to improve the information retrieval process of biomedical curators, who manually build knowledge bases for personalized medicine. We study how to exploit the relationships between genes, variants, drugs, diseases and outcomes as features for document ranking and query refinement. For a supervised approach, we are faced with a small amount of annotated data and a large amount of unannotated data. Therefore, we explore ways to use a neural document auto-encoder in a semi-supervised approach. We show that a combination of established algorithms, feature-engineering and a neural auto-encoder model yield promising results in this setting.</abstract>

        <abstract>Event and relation extraction are central tasks in biomedical text mining. Where relation extraction concerns the detection of semantic connections between pairs of entities, event extraction expands this concept with the addition of trigger words, multiple arguments and nested events, in order to more accurately model the diversity of natural language. In this work we develop a convolutional neural network that can be used for both event and relation extraction. We use a linear representation of the input text, where information is encoded with various vector space embeddings. Most notably, we encode the parse graph into this linear space using dependency path embeddings. We integrate our neural network into the open source Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) framework. Using this system, our machine learning model can be easily applied to a large set of corpora from e.g. the BioNLP, DDI Extraction and BioCreative shared tasks. We evaluate our system on 12 different event, relation and NER corpora, showing good generalizability to many tasks and achieving improved performance on several corpora.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we present a novel Biomedical Question Answering system, BioAMA: "Biomedical Ask Me Anything" on task 5b of the annual BioASQ challenge. In this work, we focus on a wide variety of question types including factoid, list based, summary and yes/no type questions that generate both exact and well-formed ideal answers. For summary-type questions, we combine effective IR-based techniques for retrieval and diversification of relevant snippets for a question to create an end-to-end system which achieves a ROUGE-2 score of 0.72 and a ROUGE-SU4 score of 0.71 on ideal answer questions (7% improvement over the previous best model). Additionally, we propose a novel NLI-based framework to answer the yes/no questions. To train the NLI model, we also devise a transfer-learning technique by cross-domain projection of word embeddings. Finally, we present a two-stage approach to address the factoid and list type questions by first generating a candidate set using NER taggers and ranking them using both supervised or unsupervised techniques.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this work, we develop a novel, completely unsupervised, neural language model-based document ranking approach to semantic tagging of documents, using the document to be tagged as a query into the GLM to retrieve candidate phrases from top-ranked related documents, thus associating every document with novel related concepts extracted from the text. For this we extend the word embedding-based general language model due to Ganguly et al 2015, to employ phrasal embeddings, and use the semantic tags thus obtained for downstream query expansion, both directly and in feedback loop settings. Our method, evaluated using the TREC 2016 clinical decision support challenge dataset, shows statistically significant improvement not only over various baselines that use standard MeSH terms and UMLS concepts for query expansion, but also over baselines using human expert&#8211;assigned concept tags for the queries, run on top of a standard Okapi BM25&#8211;based document retrieval system.</abstract>

We experiment with two common neural architectures, CNN and LSTM, to learn word vector representations from character embeddings. Through a task on the BioCreative-V CDR corpus, extracting relationships between chemicals and diseases, we show that models exploiting the character-based word representations improve on models that do not use this information, obtaining state-of-the-art result relative to previous neural approaches.</abstract>

        <abstract>With the development of medical information management, numerous medical data are being classified, indexed, and searched in various systems. Disease phrase matching, i.e., deciding whether two given disease phrases interpret each other, is a basic but crucial preprocessing step for the above tasks. Being capable of relieving the scarceness of annotations, domain adaptation is generally considered useful in medical systems. However, efforts on applying it to phrase matching remain limited. This paper presents a domain-adaptive matching network for disease phrases. Our network achieves domain adaptation by adversarial training, i.e., preferring features indicating whether the two phrases match, rather than which domain they come from. Experiments suggest that our model has the best performance among the very few non-adaptive or adaptive methods that can benefit from out-of-domain annotations.</abstract>

        <abstract>Overcrowding in emergency rooms is a major challenge faced by hospitals across the United States. Overcrowding can result in longer wait times, which, in turn, has been shown to adversely affect patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and procedure reimbursements. This paper presents research that aims to automatically predict discharge disposition of patients who received medical treatment in an emergency department. We make use of a corpus that consists of notes containing patient complaints, diagnosis information, and disposition, entered by health care providers. We use this corpus to develop a model that uses the complaint and diagnosis information to predict patient disposition. We show that the proposed model substantially outperforms the baseline of predicting the most common disposition type. The long-term goal of this research is to build a model that can be implemented as a real-time service in an application to predict disposition as patients arrive.</abstract>

        <abstract>Automatic recognition of biomedical entities in text is the crucial initial step in biomedical text mining. In this pa-per, we investigate employing modern neural network models for recognizing biomedical entities. To compensate for the small amount of training data in biomedical domain, we propose to integrate dictionaries into the neural model. Our experiments on BB3 data sets demonstrate that state-of-the-art neural network model is promising in recognizing biomedical entities even with very little training data. When integrated with dictionaries, its performance could be greatly improved, achieving the competitive performance compared with the best dictionary-based system on the entities with specific terminology, and much higher performance on the entities with more general terminology.</abstract>

        <abstract>A search that is targeted at finding a specific document in databases is called a Single Citation search. Single citation searches are particularly important for scholarly databases, such as PubMed, because users are frequently searching for a specific publication. In this work we describe SingleCite, a single citation matching system designed to facilitate user’s search for a specific document. We report on the progress that has been achieved towards building that functionality.</abstract>

        <abstract>We investigate the quality of task specific word embeddings created with relatively small, targeted corpora. We present a comprehensive evaluation framework including both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation that can be expanded to named entities beyond drug name. Intrinsic evaluation results tell that drug name embeddings created with a domain specific document corpus outperformed the previously published versions that derived from a very large general text corpus. Extrinsic evaluation uses word embedding for the task of drug name recognition with Bi-LSTM model and the results demonstrate the advantage of using domain-specific word embeddings as the only input feature for drug name recognition with F1-score achieving 0.91. This work suggests that it may be advantageous to derive domain specific embeddings for certain tasks even when the domain specific corpus is of limited size.</abstract>

        <abstract>Creating simulated search environments has been of a significant interest in infor-mation retrieval, in both general and bio-medical search domains. Existing collec-tions include modest number of queries and are constructed by manually evaluat-ing retrieval results. In this work we pro-pose leveraging MeSH term assignments for creating synthetic test beds. We select a suitable subset of MeSH terms as queries, and utilize MeSH term assignments as pseudo-relevance rankings for retrieval evaluation. Using well studied retrieval functions, we show that their performance on the proposed data is consistent with similar findings in previous work. We further use the proposed retrieval evaluation framework to better understand how to combine heterogeneous sources of textual information.</abstract>

        <abstract>This study focuses on highly accurate prediction of the onset of type-2 diabetes. We investigated whether prediction accuracy can be improved by utilizing lab test data obtained from health checkups and incorporating health claim text data such as medically diagnosed diseases with ICD10 codes and pharmacy information. In a previous study, prediction accuracy was increased slightly by adding diagnosis disease name and independent variables such as prescription medicine. Therefore, in the current study we explored more suitable models for prediction by using state-of-the-art techniques such as XGBoost and long short-term memory (LSTM) based on recurrent neural networks. In the current study, text data was vectorized using word2vec, and the prediction model was compared with logistic regression. The results obtained confirmed that onset of type-2 diabetes can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy when the XGBoost model is used.</abstract>

        <abstract>High quality word embeddings are of great significance to advance applications of biomedical natural language processing. In recent years, a surge of interest on how to learn good embeddings and evaluate embedding quality based on English medical text has become increasing evident, however a limited number of studies based on Chinese medical text, particularly Chinese clinical records, were performed. Herein, we proposed a novel approach of improving the quality of learned embeddings using out-domain data as a supplementary in the case of limited Chinese clinical records. Moreover, the embedding quality evaluation method was conducted based on Medical Conceptual Similarity Property. The experimental results revealed that selecting good training samples was necessary, and collecting right amount of out-domain data and trading off between the quality of embeddings and the training time consumption were essential factors for better embeddings.</abstract>

        <abstract>Existing biomedical coreference resolu- tion systems depend on features and/or rules based on syntactic parsers. In this pa- per, we investigate the utility of the state- of-the-art general domain neural coref- erence resolution system on biomedical texts. The system is an end-to-end sys- tem without depending on any syntactic parsers. We also investigate the domain specific features to enhance the system for biomedical texts. Experimental results on the BioNLP Protein Coreference dataset and the CRAFT corpus show that, with no parser information, the adapted sys- tem compared favorably with the systems that depend on parser information on these datasets, achieving 51.23% on the BioNLP dataset and 36.33% on the CRAFT corpus in F1 score. In-domain embeddings and domain-specific features helped improve the performance on the BioNLP dataset, but they did not on the CRAFT corpus.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a novel annotation task evaluating a patient's engagement with their health care regimen. The concept of engagement supplements the traditional concept of adherence with a focus on the patient's affect, lifestyle choices, and health goal status. We describe an engagement annotation task across two patient note domains: traditional clinical notes and a novel domain, care manager notes, where we find engagement to be more common. The annotation task resulted in a kappa of .53, suggesting strong annotator intuitions regarding engagement-bearing language. In addition, we report the results of a series of preliminary engagement classification experiments using domain adaptation.</abstract>

        <abstract>In recent years, the journalists and computer sciences speak to each other to identify useful technologies which would help them in extracting useful information. This is called "computational Journalism". In this paper, we present a method that will enable the journalists to automatically identifies and annotates entities such as names of people, organizations, role and functions of people in legal documents; the relationship between these entities are also explored. The system uses a combination of both statistical and rule based technique. The statistical method used is Conditional Random Fields and for the rule based technique, document and language specific regular expressions are used.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents a method of designing specific high-order dependency factor on the linear chain conditional random fields (CRFs) for named entity recognition (NER). Named entities tend to be separated from each other by multiple outside tokens in a text, and thus the first-order CRF, as well as the second-order CRF, may innately lose transition information between distant named entities. The proposed design uses outside label in NER as a transmission medium of precedent entity information on the CRF. Then, empirical results apparently demonstrate that it is possible to exploit long-distance label dependency in the original first-order linear chain CRF structure upon NER while reducing computational loss rather than in the second-order CRF.</abstract>

        <abstract>Recent collective Entity Linking studies usually promote global coherence of all the mapped entities in the same document by using semantic embeddings and graph-based approaches. Although graph-based approaches are shown to achieve remarkable results, they are computationally expensive for general datasets. Also, semantic embeddings only indicate relatedness between entity pairs without considering sequences. In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a two-fold neural model. First, we match easy mention-entity pairs and using the domain information of this pair to filter candidate entities of closer mentions. Second, we resolve more ambiguous pairs using bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and CRF models for the entity disambiguation. Our proposed system outperforms state-of-the-art systems on the generated domain-specific evaluation dataset.</abstract>

        <abstract>The problem of sequence labelling in language understanding would benefit from approaches inspired by semantic priming phenomena. We propose that an attention-based RNN architecture can be used to simulate semantic priming for sequence labelling. Specifically, we employ pre-trained word embeddings to characterize the semantic relationship between utterances and labels. We validate the approach using varying sizes of the ATIS and MEDIA datasets, and show up to 1.4-1.9% improvement in F1 score. The developed framework can enable more explainable and generalizable spoken language understanding systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a major task in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and also is a sub-task of Information Extraction. The challenge of NER for tweets lie in the insufficient information available in a tweet. There has been a significant amount of work done related to entity extraction, but only for resource rich languages and domains such as newswire. Entity extraction is, in general, a challenging task for such an informal text, and code-mixed text further complicates the process with it's unstructured and incomplete information. We propose experiments with different machine learning classification algorithms with word, character and lexical features. The algorithms we experimented with are Decision tree, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Conditional Random Field (CRF). In this paper, we present a corpus for NER in Hindi-English Code-Mixed along with extensive experiments on our machine learning models which achieved the best f1-score of 0.95 with both CRF and LSTM.</abstract>

        <abstract>Proper names of organisations are a special case of collective nouns. Their meaning can be conceptualised as a collective unit or as a plurality of persons, allowing for different morphological marking of coreferent anaphoric pronouns. This paper explores the variability of references to organisation names with 1) a corpus analysis and 2) two crowd-sourced story continuation experiments. The first shows that the preference for singular vs. plural conceptualisation is dependent on the level of formality of a text. In the second, we observe a strong preference for the plural they otherwise typical of informal speech. Using edited corpus data instead of constructed sentences as stimuli reduces this preference.</abstract>

        <abstract>Customized translation need pay spe-cial attention to the target domain ter-minology especially the named-entities for the domain. Adding linguistic features to neural machine translation (NMT) has been shown to benefit translation in many studies. In this paper, we further demonstrate that adding named-entity (NE) feature with named-entity recognition (NER) into the source language produces better translation with NMT. Our experiments show that by just including the different NE classes and boundary tags, we can increase the BLEU score by around 1 to 2 points using the standard test sets from WMT2017. We also show that adding NE tags using NER and applying in-domain adaptation can be combined to further improve customized machine translation.</abstract>

        <abstract>Transliteration is defined as phonetic translation of names across languages. Transliteration of Named Entities (NEs) is necessary in many applications, such as machine translation, corpus alignment, cross-language IR, information extraction and automatic lexicon acquisition. All such systems call for high-performance transliteration, which is the focus of shared task in the NEWS 2018 workshop. The objective of the shared task is to promote machine transliteration research by providing a common benchmarking platform for the community to evaluate the state-of-the-art technologies.</abstract>

        <abstract>This report presents the results from the Named Entity Transliteration Shared Task conducted as part of The Seventh Named Entities Workshop (NEWS 2018) held at ACL 2018 in Melbourne, Australia. Similar to previous editions of NEWS, the Shared Task featured 19 tasks on proper name transliteration, including 13 different languages and two different Japanese scripts. A total of 6 teams from 8 different institutions participated in the evaluation, submitting 424 runs, involving different transliteration methodologies. Four performance metrics were used to report the evaluation results. The NEWS shared task on machine transliteration has successfully achieved its objectives by providing a common ground for the research community to conduct comparative evaluations of state-of-the-art technologies that will benefit the future research and development in this area.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper reports the results of our trans-literation experiments conducted on NEWS 2018 Shared Task dataset. We focus on creating the baseline systems trained using two open-source, statistical transliteration tools, namely Sequitur and Moses. We discuss the pre-processing steps performed on this dataset for both the systems. We also provide a re-ranking system which uses top hypotheses from Sequitur and Moses to create a consolidated list of transliterations. The results obtained from each of these models can be used to present a good starting point for the participating teams.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we propose different architectures for language independent machine transliteration which is extremely important for natural language processing (NLP) applications. Though a number of statistical models for transliteration have already been proposed in the past few decades, we proposed some neural network based deep learning architectures for the transliteration of named entities. Our transliteration systems adapt two different neural machine translation (NMT) frameworks: recurrent neural network and convolutional sequence to sequence based NMT. It is shown that our method provides quite satisfactory results when it comes to multi lingual machine transliteration. Our submitted runs are an ensemble of different transliteration systems for all the language pairs. In the NEWS 2018 Shared Task on Transliteration, our method achieves top performance for the En&#8211;Pe and Pe&#8211;En language pairs and comparable results for other cases.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the results of our experiments in the context of the NEWS 2018 Shared Task on Transliteration. We focus on the comparison of several diverse systems, including three neural MT models. A combination of discriminative, generative, and neural models obtains the best results on the development sets. We also put forward ideas for improving the shared task.</abstract>

        <abstract>Transliterating named entities from one language into another can be approached as neural machine translation (NMT) problem, for which we use deep attentional RNN encoder-decoder models. To build a strong transliteration system, we apply well-established techniques from NMT, such as dropout regularization, model ensembling, rescoring with right-to-left models, and back-translation. Our submission to the NEWS 2018 Shared Task on Named Entity Transliteration ranked first in several tracks.</abstract>

        <abstract>Grapheme-to-phoneme models are key components in automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech systems. With low-resource language pairs that do not have available and well-developed pronunciation lexicons, grapheme-to-phoneme models are particularly useful. These models are based on initial alignments between grapheme source and phoneme target sequences. Inspired by sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network-based translation methods, the current research presents an approach that applies an alignment representation for input sequences and pre-trained source and target embeddings to overcome the transliteration problem for a low-resource languages pair. We participated in the NEWS 2018 shared task for the English-Vietnamese transliteration task.</abstract>

        <abstract>Modern natural language processing (NLP) research requires writing code. Ideally this code would provide a precise definition of the approach, easy repeatability of results, and a basis for extending the research. However, many research codebases bury high-level parameters under implementation details, are challenging to run and debug, and are difficult enough to extend that they are more likely to be rewritten. This paper describes AllenNLP, a library for applying deep learning methods to NLP research that addresses these issues with easy-to-use command-line tools, declarative configuration-driven experiments, and modular NLP abstractions. AllenNLP has already increased the rate of research experimentation and the sharing of NLP components at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, and we are working to have the same impact across the field.</abstract>

        <abstract>Open-source software packages for language processing often include stop word lists. Users may apply them without awareness of their surprising omissions (e.g. "hasn't" but not "hadn't") and inclusions ("computer"), or their incompatibility with a particular tokenizer. Motivated by issues raised about the Scikit-learn stop list, we investigate variation among and consistency within 52 popular English-language stop lists, and propose strategies for mitigating these issues.</abstract>

        <abstract>We introduce Texar, an open-source toolkit aiming to support the broad set of text generation tasks. Different from many existing toolkits that are specialized for specific applications (e.g., neural machine translation), Texar is designed to be highly flexible and versatile. This is achieved by abstracting the common patterns underlying the diverse tasks and methodologies, creating a library of highly reusable modules and functionalities, and enabling arbitrary model architectures and various algorithmic paradigms. The features make Texar particularly suitable for technique sharing and generalization across different text generation applications. The toolkit emphasizes heavily on extensibility and modularized system design, so that components can be freely plugged in or swapped out. We conduct extensive experiments and case studies to demonstrate the use and advantage of the toolkit.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Association of Computational Linguistic's Anthology is the open source archive, and the main source for computational linguistics and natural language processing's scientific literature. The ACL Anthology is currently maintained exclusively by community volunteers and has to be available and up-to-date at all times. We first discuss the current, open source approach used to achieve this, and then discuss how the planned use of Docker images will improve the Anthology's long-term stability. This change will make it easier for researchers to utilize Anthology data for experimentation. We believe the ACL community can directly benefit from the extension-friendly architecture of the Anthology. We end by issuing an open challenge of reviewer matching we encourage the community to rally towards.</abstract>

        <abstract>UKB is an open source collection of programs for performing, among other tasks, Knowledge-Based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). Since it was released in 2009 it has been often used out-of-the-box in sub-optimal settings. We show that nine years later it is the state-of-the-art on knowledge-based WSD. This case shows the pitfalls of releasing open source NLP software without optimal default settings and precise instructions for reproducibility.</abstract>

        <abstract>We introduce Baseline: a library for reproducible deep learning research and fast model development for NLP. The library provides easily extensible abstractions and implementations for data loading, model development, training and export of deep learning architectures. It also provides implementations for simple, high-performance, deep learning models for various NLP tasks, against which newly developed models can be compared. Deep learning experiments are hard to reproduce, Baseline provides functionalities to track them. The goal is to allow a researcher to focus on model development, delegating the repetitive tasks to the library.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present OpenSeq2Seq &#8211; an open-source toolkit for training sequence-to-sequence models. The main goal of our toolkit is to allow researchers to most effectively explore different sequence-to-sequence architectures. The efficiency is achieved by fully supporting distributed and mixed-precision training. OpenSeq2Seq provides building blocks for training encoder-decoder models for neural machine translation and automatic speech recognition. We plan to extend it with other modalities in the future.</abstract>

        <abstract>The open-source SUMMA Platform is a highly scalable distributed architecture for monitoring a large number of media broadcasts in parallel, with a lag behind actual broadcast time of at most a few minutes. It assembles numerous state-of-the-art NLP technologies into a fully automated media ingestion pipeline that can record live broadcasts, detect and transcribe spoken content, translate from several languages (original text or transcribed speech) into English, recognize Named Entities, detect topics, cluster and summarize documents across language barriers, and extract and store factual claims in these news items. This paper describes the intended use cases and discusses the system design decisions that allowed us to integrate state-of-the-art NLP modules into an effective workflow with comparatively little effort.</abstract>

        <abstract>(Note this is not being submitted blind. The chair of the workshop requested this submission unblinded from me on twitter, so assuming that is okay.) A major goal of open-source NLP is to quickly and accurately reproduce the results of new work, in a manner that the community can easily use and modify. While most papers publish enough detail for replication, it still may be difficult to achieve good results in practice. This paper presents a worked exercise of paper reproduction with the goal of implementing the results of the recent Transformer model. The replication exercise aims at simple code structure that follows closely with the original work, while achieving an efficient usable system.</abstract>

        <abstract>To answer the question in machine comprehension (MC) task, the models need to establish the interaction between the question and the context. To tackle the problem that the single-pass model cannot reflect on and correct its answer, we present Ruminating Reader. Ruminating Reader adds a second pass of attention and a novel information fusion component to the Bi-Directional Attention Flow model (BiDAF). We propose novel layer structures that construct a query aware context vector representation and fuse encoding representation with intermediate representation on top of BiDAF model. We show that a multi-hop attention mechanism can be applied to a bi-directional attention structure. In experiments on SQuAD, we find that the Reader outperforms the BiDAF baseline by 2.1 F1 score and 2.7 EM score. Our analysis shows that different hops of the attention have different responsibilities in selecting answers.</abstract>

        <abstract>We analyzed the outputs of multiple question answering (QA) models applied to the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) to identify the core challenges for QA systems on this data set. Through an iterative process, challenging aspects were hypothesized through qualitative analysis of the common error cases. A classifier was then constructed to predict whether SQuAD test examples were likely to be difficult for systems to answer based on features associated with the hypothesized aspects. The classifier’s performance was used to accept or reject each aspect as an indicator of difficulty. With this approach, we ensured that our hypotheses were systematically tested and not simply accepted based on our pre-existing biases. Our explanations are not accepted based on human evaluation of individual examples. This process also enabled us to identify the primary QA strategy learned by the models, i.e., systems determined the acceptable answer type for a question and then selected the acceptable answer span of that type containing the highest density of words present in the question within its local vicinity in the passage.</abstract>

        <abstract>Reading Comprehension (RC) of text is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. In recent years, several end-to-end neural network models have been proposed to solve RC tasks. However, most of these models suffer in reasoning over long documents. In this work, we propose a novel Memory Augmented Machine Comprehension Network (MAMCN) to address long-range dependencies present in machine reading comprehension. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate proposed method with the renowned benchmark datasets such as SQuAD, QUASAR-T, and TriviaQA. We achieve the state of the art performance on both the document-level (QUASAR-T, TriviaQA) and paragraph-level (SQuAD) datasets compared to all the previously published approaches.</abstract>

        <abstract>Question answering systems deteriorate dramatically in the presence of adversarial sentences in articles. According to Jia and Liang (2017), the single BiDAF system (Seo et al., 2016) only achieves an F1 score of 4.8 on the ADDANY adversarial dataset. In this paper, we present a method to tackle this problem via answer sentence selection. Given a paragraph of an article and a corresponding query, instead of directly feeding the whole paragraph to the single BiDAF system, a sentence that most likely contains the answer to the query is first selected, which is done via a deep neural network based on TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015). Experiments on ADDANY adversarial dataset validate the effectiveness of our method. The F1 score has been improved to 52.3.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper introduces DuReader, a new large-scale, open-domain Chinese machine reading comprehension (MRC) dataset, designed to address real-world MRC. DuReader has three advantages over previous MRC datasets: (1) data sources: questions and documents are based on Baidu Search and Baidu Zhidao; answers are manually generated. (2) question types: it provides rich annotations for more question types, especially yes-no and opinion questions, that leaves more opportunity for the research community. (3) scale: it contains 200K questions, 420K answers and 1M documents; it is the largest Chinese MRC dataset so far. Experiments show that human performance is well above current state-of-the-art baseline systems, leaving plenty of room for the community to make improvements. To help the community make these improvements, both DuReader and baseline systems have been posted online. We also organize a shared competition to encourage the exploration of more models. Since the release of the task, there are significant improvements over the baselines.</abstract>

        <abstract>Deep learning models are often not easily adaptable to new tasks and require task-specific adjustments. The differentiable neural computer (DNC), a memory-augmented neural network, is designed as a general problem solver which can be used in a wide range of tasks. But in reality, it is hard to apply this model to new tasks. We analyze the DNC and identify possible improvements within the application of question answering. This motivates a more robust and scalable DNC (rsDNC). The objective precondition is to keep the general character of this model intact while making its application more reliable and speeding up its required training time. The rsDNC is distinguished by a more robust training, a slim memory unit and a bidirectional architecture. We not only achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI task, but also minimize the performance variance between different initializations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the simplified applicability of the rsDNC to new tasks with passable results on the CNN RC task without adaptions.</abstract>

        <abstract>The recent work of Clark et al. (2018) introduces the AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) and the associated ARC dataset that partitions open domain, complex science questions into easy and challenge sets. That paper includes an analysis of 100 questions with respect to the types of knowledge and reasoning required to answer them; however, it does not include clear definitions of these types, nor does it offer information about the quality of the labels. We propose a comprehensive set of definitions of knowledge and reasoning types necessary for answering the questions in the ARC dataset. Using ten annotators and a sophisticated annotation interface, we analyze the distribution of labels across the challenge set and statistics related to them. Additionally, we demonstrate that although naive information retrieval methods return sentences that are irrelevant to answering the query, sufficient supporting text is often present in the (ARC) corpus. Evaluating with human-selected relevant sentences improves the performance of a neural machine comprehension model by 42 points.</abstract>

        <abstract>We describe our experiences in using an open domain question answering model (Chen et al., 2017) to evaluate an out-of-domain QA task of assisting in analyzing privacy policies of companies. Specifically, Relevant CI Parameters Extractor (RECIPE) seeks to answer questions posed by the theory of contextual integrity (CI) regarding the information flows described in the privacy statements. These questions have a simple syntactic structure and the answers are factoids or descriptive in nature. The model achieved an F1 score of 72.33, but we noticed that combining the results of this model with a neural dependency parser based approach yields a significantly higher F1 score of 92.35 compared to manual annotations. This indicates that future work which in-corporates signals from parsing like NLP tasks more explicitly can generalize better on out-of-domain tasks.</abstract>

        <abstract>We propose a two-stage neural model to tackle question generation from documents. First, our model estimates the probability that word sequences in a document are ones that a human would pick when selecting candidate answers by training a neural key-phrase extractor on the answers in a question-answering corpus. Predicted key phrases then act as target answers and condition a sequence-to-sequence question-generation model with a copy mechanism. Empirically, our key-phrase extraction model significantly outperforms an entity-tagging baseline and existing rule-based approaches. We further demonstrate that our question generation system formulates fluent, answerable questions from key phrases. This two-stage system could be used to augment or generate reading comprehension datasets, which may be leveraged to improve machine reading systems or in educational settings.</abstract>

        <abstract>The task of Question Answering has gained prominence in the past few decades for testing the ability of machines to understand natural language. Large datasets for Machine Reading have led to the development of neural models that cater to deeper language understanding compared to information retrieval tasks. Different components in these neural architectures are intended to tackle different challenges. As a first step towards achieving generalization across multiple domains, we attempt to understand and compare the peculiarities of existing end-to-end neural models on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) by performing quantitative as well as qualitative analysis of the results attained by each of them. We observed that prediction errors reflect certain model-specific biases, which we further discuss in this paper.</abstract>

        <abstract>Current evaluation metrics to question answering based machine reading comprehension (MRC) systems generally focus on the lexical overlap between candidate and reference answers, such as ROUGE and BLEU. However, bias may appear when these metrics are used for specific question types, especially questions inquiring yes-no opinions and entity lists. In this paper, we make adaptations on the metrics to better correlate $n$-gram overlap with the human judgment for answers to these two question types. Statistical analysis proves the effectiveness of our approach. Our adaptations may provide positive guidance for the development of real-scene MRC systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>This document describes the findings of the Second Workshop on Neural Machine Translation and Generation, held in concert with the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2018). First, we summarize the research trends of papers presented in the proceedings, and note that there is particular interest in linguistic structure, domain adaptation, data augmentation, handling inadequate resources, and analysis of models. Second, we describe the results of the workshop’s shared task on efficient neural machine translation, where participants were tasked with creating MT systems that are both accurate and efficient.</abstract>

        <abstract>Automatic post-editing (APE) systems aim to correct the systematic errors made by machine translators. In this paper, we propose a neural APE system that encodes the source (src) and machine translated (mt) sentences with two separate encoders, but leverages a shared attention mechanism to better understand how the two inputs contribute to the generation of the post-edited (pe) sentences. Our empirical observations have showed that when the mt is incorrect, the attention shifts weight toward tokens in the src sentence to properly edit the incorrect translation. The model has been trained and evaluated on the official data from the WMT16 and WMT17 APE IT domain English-German shared tasks. Additionally, we have used the extra 500K artificial data provided by the shared task. Our system has been able to reproduce the accuracies of systems trained with the same data, while at the same time providing better interpretability.</abstract>

        <abstract>Machine translation systems require semantic knowledge and grammatical understanding. Neural machine translation (NMT) systems often assume this information is captured by an attention mechanism and a decoder that ensures fluency. Recent work has shown that incorporating explicit syntax alleviates the burden of modeling both types of knowledge. However, requiring parses is expensive and does not explore the question of what syntax a model needs during translation. To address both of these issues we introduce a model that simultaneously translates while inducing dependency trees. In this way, we leverage the benefits of structure while investigating what syntax NMT must induce to maximize performance. We show that our dependency trees are 1. language pair dependent and 2. improve translation quality.</abstract>

        <abstract>Supervised domain adaptation&#8212;where a large generic corpus and a smaller in-domain corpus are both available for training&#8212;is a challenge for neural machine translation (NMT). Standard practice is to train a generic model and use it to initialize a second model, then continue training the second model on in-domain data to produce an in-domain model. We add an auxiliary term to the training objective during continued training that minimizes the cross entropy between the in-domain model's output word distribution and that of the out-of-domain model to prevent the model's output from differing too much from the original out-of-domain model. We perform experiments on EMEA (descriptions of medicines) and TED (rehearsed presentations), initialized from a general domain (WMT) model. Our method shows improvements over standard continued training by up to 1.5 BLEU.</abstract>

        <abstract>Current models for document summarization disregard user preferences such as the desired length, style, the entities that the user might be interested in, or how much of the document the user has already read. We present a neural summarization model with a simple but effective mechanism to enable users to specify these high level attributes in order to control the shape of the final summaries to better suit their needs. With user input, our system can produce high quality summaries that follow user preferences. Without user input, we set the control variables automatically &#8211; on the full text CNN-Dailymail dataset, we outperform state of the art abstractive systems (both in terms of F1-ROUGE1 40.38 vs. 39.53 F1-ROUGE and human evaluation.</abstract>

        <abstract>A large-scale parallel corpus is required to train encoder-decoder neural machine translation. The method of using synthetic parallel texts, in which target monolingual corpora are automatically translated into source sentences, is effective in improving the decoder, but is unreliable for enhancing the encoder. In this paper, we propose a method that enhances the encoder and attention using target monolingual corpora by generating multiple source sentences via sampling. By using multiple source sentences, diversity close to that of humans is achieved. Our experimental results show that the translation quality is improved by increasing the number of synthetic source sentences for each given target sentence, and quality close to that using a manually created parallel corpus was achieved.</abstract>

        <abstract>It is common practice to adapt machine translation systems to novel domains, but even a well-adapted system may be able to perform better on a particular document if it were to learn from a translator's corrections within the document itself. We focus on adaptation within a single document &#8211; appropriate for an interactive translation scenario where a model adapts to a human translator's input over the course of a document. We propose two methods: single-sentence adaptation (which performs online adaptation one sentence at a time) and dictionary adaptation (which specifically addresses the issue of translating novel words). Combining the two models results in improvements over both approaches individually, and over baseline systems, even on short documents. On WMT news test data, we observe an improvement of +1.8 BLEU points and +23.3% novel word translation accuracy and on EMEA data (descriptions of medications) we observe an improvement of +2.7 BLEU points and +49.2% novel word translation accuracy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We examine how various types of noise in the parallel training data impact the quality of neural machine translation systems. We create five types of artificial noise and analyze how they degrade performance in neural and statistical machine translation. We find that neural models are generally more harmed by noise than statistical models. For one especially egregious type of noise they learn to just copy the input sentence.</abstract>

        <abstract>Despite impressive progress in high-resource settings, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) still struggles in low-resource and out-of-domain scenarios, often failing to match the quality of phrase-based translation. We propose a novel technique that combines back-translation and multilingual NMT to improve performance in these difficult cases. Our technique trains a single model for both directions of a language pair, allowing us to back-translate source or target monolingual data without requiring an auxiliary model. We then continue training on the augmented parallel data, enabling a cycle of improvement for a single model that can incorporate any source, target, or parallel data to improve both translation directions. As a byproduct, these models can reduce training and deployment costs significantly compared to uni-directional models. Extensive experiments show that our technique outperforms standard back-translation in low-resource scenarios, improves quality on cross-domain tasks, and effectively reduces costs across the board.</abstract>

        <abstract>Multi-source translation is an approach to exploit multiple inputs (e.g. in two different languages) to increase translation accuracy. In this paper, we examine approaches for multi-source neural machine translation (NMT) using an incomplete multilingual corpus in which some translations are missing. In practice, many multilingual corpora are not complete due to the difficulty to provide translations in all of the relevant languages (for example, in TED talks, most English talks only have subtitles for a small portion of the languages that TED supports). Existing studies on multi-source translation did not explicitly handle such situations. This study focuses on the use of incomplete multilingual corpora in multi-encoder NMT and mixture of NMT experts and examines a very simple implementation where missing source translations are replaced by a special symbol -NULL-. These methods allow us to use incomplete corpora both at training time and test time. In experiments with real incomplete multilingual corpora of TED Talks, the multi-source NMT with the -NULL- tokens achieved higher translation accuracies measured by BLEU than those by any one-to-one NMT systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>Neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the quality of automatic translation models. One of the main challenges in current systems is the translation of rare words. We present a generic approach to address this weakness by having external models annotate the training data as Experts, and control the model-expert interaction with a pointer network and reinforcement learning. Our experiments using phrase-based models to simulate Experts to complement neural machine translation models show that the model can be trained to copy the annotations into the output consistently. We demonstrate the benefit of our proposed framework in outof domain translation scenarios with only lexical resources, improving more than 1.0 BLEU point in both translation directions English-Spanish and German-English.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes the NICT neural machine translation system submitted at the NMT-2018 shared task. A characteristic of our approach is the introduction of self-training. Since our self-training does not change the model structure, it does not influence the efficiency of translation, such as the translation speed. The experimental results showed that the translation quality improved not only in the sequence-to-sequence (seq-to-seq) models but also in the transformer models.</abstract>

We focus on efficient implementation of the recurrent deep-learning model as implemented in Amun, the fast inference engine for neural machine translation. We improve the performance with an efficient mini-batching algorithm, and by fusing the softmax operation with the k-best extraction algorithm. Submissions using Amun were first, second and third fastest in the GPU efficiency track.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a system description of the OpenNMT Neural Machine Translation entry for the WNMT 2018 evaluation. In this work, we developed a heavily optimized NMT inference model targeting a high-performance CPU system. The final system uses a combination of four techniques, all of them lead to significant speed-ups in combination: (a) sequence distillation, (b) architecture modifications, (c) precomputation, particularly of vocabulary, and (d) CPU targeted quantization. This work achieves the fastest performance of the shared task, and led to the development of new features that have been integrated to OpenNMT and available to the community.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes the submissions of the "Marian" team to the WNMT 2018 shared task. We investigate combinations of teacher-student training, low-precision matrix products, auto-tuning and other methods to optimize the Transformer model on GPU and CPU. By further integrating these methods with the new averaging attention networks, a recently introduced faster Transformer variant, we create a number of high-quality, high-performance models on the GPU and CPU, dominating the Pareto frontier for this shared task.</abstract>

        <abstract>The task of taking a semantic representation of a noun and predicting the brain activity triggered by it in terms of fMRI spatial patterns was pioneered by Mitchell et al. 2008. That seminal work used word co-occurrence features to represent the meaning of the nouns. Even though the task does not impose any specific type of semantic representation, the vast majority of subsequent approaches resort to feature-based models or to semantic spaces (aka word embeddings). We address this task, with competitive results, by using instead a semantic network to encode lexical semantics, thus providing further evidence for the cognitive plausibility of this approach to model lexical meaning.</abstract>

        <abstract>A number of different discourse connectives can be used to mark the same discourse relation, but it is unclear what factors affect connective choice. One recent account is the Rational Speech Acts theory, which predicts that speakers try to maximize the informativeness of an utterance such that the listener can interpret the intended meaning correctly. Existing prior work uses referential language games to test the rational account of speakers' production of concrete meanings, such as identification of objects within a picture. Building on the same paradigm, we design a novel Discourse Continuation Game to investigate speakers' production of abstract discourse relations. Experimental results reveal that speakers significantly prefer a more informative connective, in line with predictions of the RSA model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present an analysis of the internal mechanism of the recurrent neural model of sentence production presented by Calvillo et al. (2016). The results show clear patterns of computation related to each layer in the network allowing to infer an algorithmic account, where the semantics activates the semantically related words, then each word generated at each time step activates syntactic and semantic constraints on possible continuations, while the recurrence preserves information through time. We propose that such insights could generalize to other models with similar architecture, including some used in computational linguistics for language modeling, machine translation and image caption generation.</abstract>

        <abstract>In recent years, a variety of recurrent neural networks have been proposed, e.g LSTM. However, existing models only read the text once, it cannot describe the situation of repeated reading in reading comprehension. In fact, when reading or analyzing a text, we may read the text several times rather than once if we couldn't well understand it. So, how to model this kind of the reading behavior? To address the issue, we propose a multi-glance mechanism (MGM) for modeling the habit of reading behavior. In the proposed framework, the actual reading process can be fully simulated, and then the obtained information can be consistent with the task. Based on the multi-glance mechanism, we design two types of recurrent neural network models for repeated reading: Glance Cell Model (GCM) and Glance Gate Model (GGM). Visualization analysis of the GCM and the GGM demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-glance mechanisms. Experiments results on the large-scale datasets show that the proposed methods can achieve better performance.</abstract>

We employed a Bayesian linear mixed model with manually annotated predicate-argument structure data. The findings from the refined corpus analysis confirmed the effects of information status of an NP as ‘givennew ordering’ in addition to the effects of ‘long-before-short’ as a tendency of the general Japanese word order.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a novel methodology involving mappings between different modes of semantic representation. We propose distributional semantic models as a mechanism for representing the kind of world knowledge inherent in the system of abstract symbols characteristic of a sophisticated community of language users. Then, motivated by insight from ecological psychology, we describe a model approximating affordances, by which we mean a language learner's direct perception of opportunities for action in an environment. We present a preliminary experiment involving mapping between these two representational modalities, and propose that our methodology can become the basis for a cognitively inspired model of grounded language learning.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present two methods that improve the assessment of cognitive models. The first method is applicable to models computing average acceptability ratings. For these models, we propose an extension that simulates a full rating distribution (instead of average ratings) and allows generating individual ratings. Our second method enables Bayesian inference for models generating individual data. To this end, we propose to use the cross-match test (Rosenbaum, 2005) as a likelihood function. We exemplarily present both methods using cognitive models from the domain of spatial language use. For spatial language use, determining linguistic acceptability judgments of a spatial preposition for a depicted spatial relation is assumed to be a crucial process (Logan and Sadler, 1996). Existing models of this process compute an average acceptability rating. We extend the models and &#8211; based on existing data &#8211; show that the extended models allow extracting more information from the empirical data and yield more readily interpretable information about model successes and failures. Applying Bayesian inference, we find that model performance relies less on mechanisms of capturing geometrical aspects than on mapping the captured geometry to a rating interval.</abstract>

We correlated complexity measures derived by the syntax-sensitive Hobbs algorithm and a neural network model for pronoun resolution with brain activity of participants listening to an audiobook during fMRI recording. Compared to the neural network model, the Hobbs algorithm is associated with larger clusters of brain activation in a network including the left Broca’s area.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents a left-corner parser for minimalist grammars. The relation between the parser and the grammar is transparent in the sense that there is a very simple 1-1 correspondence between derivations and parses. Like left-corner context-free parsers, left-corner minimalist parsers can be non-terminating when the grammar has empty left corners, so an easily computed left-corner oracle is defined to restrict the search.</abstract>

        <abstract>This work introduces a novel, linguistically motivated architecture for composing morphemes to derive word embeddings. The principal novelty in the work is to treat stems as vectors and affixes as functions over vectors. In this way, our model’s architecture more closely resembles the compositionality of morphemes in natural language. Such a model stands in opposition to models which treat morphemes uniformly, making no distinction between stem and affix. We run this new architecture on a dependency parsing task in Korean&#8212;a language rich in derivational morphology&#8212;and compare it against a lexical baseline,along with other sub-word architectures. StAffNet, the name of our architecture, shows competitive performance with the state-of-the-art on this task.</abstract>

        <abstract>Incorporating source syntactic information into neural machine translation (NMT) has recently proven successful (Eriguchi et al., 2016; Luong et al., 2016). However, this is generally done using an outside parser to syntactically annotate the training data, making this technique difficult to use for languages or domains for which a reliable parser is not available. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised tree-to-sequence (tree2seq) model for neural machine translation; this model is able to induce an unsupervised hierarchical structure on the source sentence based on the downstream task of neural machine translation. We adapt the Gumbel tree-LSTM of Choi et al. (2018) to NMT in order to create the encoder. We evaluate our model against sequential and supervised parsing baselines on three low- and medium-resource language pairs. For low-resource cases, the unsupervised tree2seq encoder significantly outperforms the baselines; no improvements are seen for medium-resource translation.</abstract>

These models often outperform baselines which use (externally provided) syntax trees to drive the composition order. This work contributes (a) a new latent tree learning model based on shift-reduce parsing, with competitive downstream performance and non-trivial induced trees, and (b) an analysis of the trees learned by our shift-reduce model and by a chart-based model.</abstract>

        <abstract>Do unsupervised methods for learning rich, contextualized token representations obviate the need for explicit modeling of linguistic structure in neural network models for semantic role labeling (SRL)? We address this question by incorporating the massively successful ELMo embeddings peters2018deep into LISA anon2018linguistically, a strong, linguistically-informed neural network architecture for SRL. In experiments on the CoNLL-2005 shared task we find that though ELMo out-performs typical word embeddings, beginning to close the gap in F1 between LISA with predicted and gold syntactic parses, syntactically-informed models still out-perform syntax-free models when both use ELMo, especially on out-of-domain data. Our results suggest that linguistic structures are indeed still relevant in this golden age of deep learning for NLP.</abstract>

        <abstract>Languages with logographic writing systems present a difficulty for traditional character-level models. Leveraging the subcharacter information was recently shown to be beneficial for a number of intrinsic and extrinsic tasks in Chinese. We examine whether the same strategies could be applied for Japanese, and contribute a new analogy dataset for this language.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper demonstrates a neural parser implementation suitable for consistently head-final languages such as Japanese. Unlike the transition- and graph-based algorithms in most state-of-the-art parsers, our parser directly selects the head word of a dependent from a limited number of candidates. This method drastically simplifies the model so that we can easily interpret the output of the neural model. Moreover, by exploiting grammatical knowledge to restrict possible modification types, we can control the output of the parser to reduce specific errors without adding annotated corpora. The neural parser performed well both on conventional Japanese corpora and the Japanese version of Universal Dependency corpus, and the advantages of distributed representations were observed in the comparison with the non-neural conventional model.</abstract>

    <abstract>Despite the popularity of word embeddings, the precise way by which they acquire semantic relations between words remain unclear. In the present article, we investigate whether LSA and word2vec capacity to identify relevant semantic relations increases with corpus size. One intuitive hypothesis is that the capacity to identify relevant associations should increase as the amount of data increases. However, if corpus size grows in topics which are not specific to the domain of interest, signal to noise ratio may weaken. Here we investigate the effect of corpus specificity and size in word-embeddings, and for this, we study two ways for progressive elimination of documents: the elimination of random documents vs. the elimination of documents unrelated to a specific task. We show that word2vec can take advantage of all the documents, obtaining its best performance when it is trained with the whole corpus. On the contrary, the specialization (removal of out-of-domain documents) of the training corpus, accompanied by a decrease of dimensionality, can increase LSA word-representation quality while speeding up the processing time. From a cognitive-modeling point of view, we point out that LSA's word-knowledge acquisitions may not be efficiently exploiting higher-order co-occurrences and global relations, whereas word2vec does.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose post-processing method for enriching not only word representation but also its vector space using semantic lexicons, which we call extrofitting. The method consists of 3 steps as follows: (i) Expanding 1 or more dimension(s) on all the word vectors, filling with their representative value. (ii) Transferring semantic knowledge by averaging each representative values of synonyms and filling them in the expanded dimension(s). These two steps make representations of the synonyms close together. (iii) Projecting the vector space using Linear Discriminant Analysis, which eliminates the expanded dimension(s) with semantic knowledge. When experimenting with GloVe, we find that our method outperforms Faruqui's retrofitting on some of word similarity task. We also report further analysis on our method in respect to word vector dimensions, vocabulary size as well as other well-known pretrained word vectors (e.g., Word2Vec, Fasttext).</abstract>

    <abstract>Recently, intelligent dialog systems and smart assistants have attracted the attention of many, and development of novel dialogue agents have become a research challenge. Intelligent agents that can handle both domain-specific task-oriented and open-domain chit-chat dialogs are one of the major requirements in the current systems. In order to address this issue and to realize such smart hybrid dialogue systems, we develop a model to discriminate user utterance between task-oriented and chit-chat conversations. We introduce a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and a lateral multiple timescale gated recurrent units (LMTGRU) that can represent multiple temporal scale dependencies for the discrimination task. With the help of the combined slow and fast units of the LMTGRU, our model effectively determines whether a user will have a chit-chat conversation or a task-specific conversation with the system. We also show that the LMTGRU structure helps the model to perform well on longer text inputs. We address the lack of dataset by constructing a dataset using Twitter and Maluuba Frames data. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed hybrid network outperforms the conventional models on the chat discrimination task as well as performed comparable to the baselines on various benchmark datasets.</abstract>

    <abstract>Incomplete linguistic input, i.e. due to a noisy environment, is one of the challenges that a successful communication system has to deal with. In this paper, we study text completion with a data set composed of sentences with gaps where a successful completion cannot be achieved through a uni-modal (language-based) approach. We present a solution based on a context-integrating dependency parser incorporating an additional non-linguistic modality. An incompleteness in one channel is compensated by information from another one and the parser learns the association between the two modalities from a multiple level knowledge representation. We examined several model variations by adjusting the degree of influence of different modalities in the decision making on possible filler words and their exact reference to a non-linguistic context element. Our model is able to fill the gap with 95.4% word and 95.2% exact reference accuracy hence the successful prediction can be achieved not only on the word level (such as mug) but also with respect to the correct identification of its context reference (such as mug 2 among several mug instances).</abstract>

    <abstract>A challenging task for word embeddings is to capture the emergent meaning or polarity of a combination of individual words. For example, existing approaches in word embeddings will assign high probabilities to the words "Penguin" and "Fly" if they frequently co-occur, but it fails to capture the fact that they occur in an opposite sense - Penguins do not fly. We hypothesize that humans do not associate a single polarity or sentiment to each word. The word contributes to the overall polarity of a combination of words depending upon which other words it is combined with. This is analogous to the behavior of microscopic particles which exist in all possible states at the same time and interfere with each other to give rise to new states depending upon their relative phases. We make use of the Hilbert Space representation of such particles in Quantum Mechanics where we subscribe a relative phase to each word, which is a complex number, and investigate two such quantum inspired models to derive the meaning of a combination of words. The proposed models achieve better performances than state-of-the-art non-quantum models on binary sentence classification tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>Natural language inference (NLI) is one of the most important tasks in NLP. In this study, we propose a novel method using word dictionaries, which are pairs of a word and its definition, as external knowledge. Our neural definition embedding mechanism encodes input sentences with the definitions of each word of the sentences on the fly. It can encode the definition of words considering the context of input sentences by using an attention mechanism. We evaluated our method using WordNet as a dictionary and confirmed that our method performed better than baseline models when using the full or a subset of 100d GloVe as word embeddings.</abstract>

    <abstract>We explore representations for multi-word names in text classification tasks, on Reuters (RCV1) topic and sector classification. We find that: the best way to treat names is to split them into tokens and use each token as a separate feature; NEs have more impact on sector classification than topic classification; replacing NEs with entity types is not an effective strategy; representing tokens by different embeddings for proper names vs. common nouns does not improve results. We highlight the improvements over state-of-the-art results that our CNN models yield.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder structure, which keeps an RNN as the encoder and has a CNN as the decoder, and the model only explores the subsequent context information as the supervision. The asymmetry in both model architecture and training pair reduces a large amount of the training time. The contribution of our work is summarized as 1. We design experiments to show that an autoregressive decoder or an RNN decoder is not necessary for the encoder-decoder type of models in terms of learning sentence representations, and based on our results, we present 2 findings. 2. The two interesting findings lead to our final model design, which has an RNN encoder and a CNN decoder, and it learns to encode the current sentence and decode the subsequent contiguous words all at once. 3. With a suite of techniques, our model performs good on downstream tasks and can be trained efficiently on a large unlabelled corpus.</abstract>

    <abstract>Representing sentences as numerical vectors while capturing their semantic context is an important and useful intermediate step in natural language processing. Representations that are both general and discriminative can serve as a tool for tackling various NLP tasks. While common sentence representation methods are unsupervised in nature, recently, an approach for learning universal sentence representation in a supervised setting was presented in (Conneau et al.,2017). We argue that although promising results were obtained, an improvement can be reached by adding various unsupervised constraints that are motivated by auto-encoders and by language models. We show that by adding such constraints, superior sentence embeddings can be achieved. We compare our method with the original implementation and show improvements in several tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>To improve word embedding, subword information has been widely employed in state-of-the-art methods. These methods can be classified to either compositional or predictive models. In this paper, we propose a hybrid learning scheme, which integrates compositional and predictive model for word embedding. Such a scheme can take advantage of both models, thus effectively learning word embedding. The proposed scheme has been applied to learn word representation on Chinese. Our results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the performance of word embedding in terms of analogical reasoning and is robust to the size of training data.</abstract>

    <abstract>Using a random walk model of text generation, Arora et al. (2017) proposed a strong baseline for computing sentence embeddings: take a weighted average of word embeddings and modify with SVD. This simple method even outperforms far more complex approaches such as LSTMs on textual similarity tasks. In this paper, we first show that word vector length has a confounding effect on the probability of a sentence being generated in Arora et al.'s model. We propose a random walk model that is robust to this confound, where the probability of word generation is inversely related to the angular distance between the word and sentence embeddings. Our approach beats Arora et al.'s by up to 44.4% on textual similarity tasks and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Unlike Arora et al.'s method, ours requires no hyperparameter tuning, which means it can be used when there is no labelled data.</abstract>

    <abstract>Embedding models typically associate each word with a single real-valued vector, representing its different properties. Evaluation methods, therefore, need to analyze the accuracy and completeness of these properties in embeddings. This requires fine-grained analysis of embedding subspaces. Multi-label classification is an appropriate way to do so. We propose a new evaluation method for word embeddings based on multi-label classification given a word embedding. The task we use is fine-grained name typing: given a large corpus, find all types that a name can refer to based on the name embedding. Given the scale of entities in knowledge bases, we can build datasets for this task that are complementary to the current embedding evaluation datasets in: they are very large, contain fine-grained classes, and allow the direct evaluation of embeddings without confounding factors like sentence context.</abstract>

    <abstract>Learning vector space representation of words (i.e., word embeddings) has recently attracted wide research interests, and has been extended to cross-lingual scenario. Currently most cross-lingual word embedding learning models are based on sentence alignment, which inevitably introduces much noise. In this paper, we show in Chinese and Japanese, the acquisition of semantic relation among words can benefit from the large number of common characters shared by both languages; inspired by this unique feature, we design a method named CJC targeting to generate cross-lingual context of words. We combine CJC with GloVe based on matrix factorization, and then propose an integrated model named CJ-Glo. Taking two sentence-aligned models and CJ-BOC (also exploits common characters but is based on CBOW) as baseline algorithms, we compare them with CJ-Glo on a series of NLP tasks including cross-lingual synonym, word analogy and sentence alignment. The result indicates CJ-Glo achieves the best performance among these methods, and is more stable in cross-lingual tasks; moreover, compared with CJ-BOC, CJ-Glo is less sensitive to the alteration of parameters.</abstract>

    <abstract>Semantic networks and semantic spaces have been two prominent approaches to represent lexical semantics. While a unified account of the lexical meaning relies on one being able to convert between these representations, in both directions, the conversion direction from semantic networks into semantic spaces started to attract more attention recently. In this paper we present a methodology for this conversion and assess it with a case study. When it is applied over WordNet, the performance of the resulting embeddings in a mainstream semantic similarity task is very good, substantially superior to the performance of word embeddings based on very large collections of texts like word2vec.</abstract>

    <abstract>Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding projects entities and relations into low dimensional vector space, which has been successfully applied in KG completion task. The previous embedding approaches only model entities and their relations, ignoring a large number of entities' numeric attributes in KGs. In this paper, we propose a new KG embedding model which jointly model entity relations and numeric attributes. Our approach combines an attribute embedding model with a translation-based structure embedding model, which learns the embeddings of entities, relations, and attributes simultaneously. Experiments of link prediction on YAGO and Freebase show that the performance is effectively improved by adding entities' numeric attributes in the embedding model.</abstract>

    <abstract>Word vector space specialisation models offer a portable, light-weight approach to fine-tuning arbitrary distributional vector spaces to discern between synonymy and antonymy. Their effectiveness is drawn from external linguistic constraints that specify the exact lexical relation between words. In this work, we show that a careful selection of the external constraints can steer and improve the specialisation. By simply selecting appropriate constraints, we report state-of-the-art results on a suite of tasks with well-defined benchmarks where modeling lexical contrast is crucial: 1) true semantic similarity, with highest reported scores on SimLex-999 and SimVerb-3500 to date; 2) detecting antonyms; and 3) distinguishing antonyms from synonyms.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we investigate the effects of using subword information in representa- tion learning. We argue that using syntactic subword units effects the quality of the word representations positively. We introduce a morpheme-based model and compare it against to word-based, character-based, and character n-gram level models. Our model takes a list of candidate segmentations of a word and learns the representation of the word based on different segmentations that are weighted by an attention mechanism. We performed experiments on Turkish as a morphologically rich language and English with a comparably poorer morphology. The results show that morpheme-based models are better at learning word representations of morphologically complex languages compared to character-based and character n-gram level models since the morphemes help to incorporate more syntactic knowledge in learning, that makes morpheme-based models better at syntactic tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose a hierarchical model for sequential data that learns a tree on-the-fly,~i.e. while reading the sequence. In the model, a recurrent network adapts its structure and reuses recurrent weights in a recursive manner. This creates adaptive skip-connections that ease the learning of long-term dependencies. The tree structure can either be inferred without supervision through reinforcement learning, or learned in a supervised manner. We provide preliminary experiments in a novel Math Expression Evaluation (MEE) task, which is created to have a hierarchical tree structure that can be used to study the effectiveness of our model. Additionally, we test our model in a well-known propositional logic and language modelling tasks. Experimental results have shown the potential of our approach.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cross-lingual representation learning is an important step in making NLP scale to all the world's languages. Previous work on bilingual lexicon induction suggests that it is possible to learn cross-lingual representations of words based on similarities between images associated with these words. However, that work focused (almost exclusively) on the translation of nouns only. Here, we investigate whether the meaning of other parts-of-speech (POS), in particular adjectives and verbs, can be learned in the same way. Our experiments across five language pairs indicate that previous work does not scale to the problem of learning cross-lingual representations beyond simple nouns.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a novel approach to learn representations for sentence-level semantic similarity using conversational data. Our method trains an unsupervised model to predict conversational responses. The resulting sentence embeddings perform well on the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Benchmark and SemEval 2017's Community Question Answering (CQA) question similarity subtask. Performance is further improved by introducing multitask training, combining conversational response prediction and natural language inference. Extensive experiments show the proposed model achieves the best performance among all neural models on the STS Benchmark and is competitive with the state-of-the-art feature engineered and mixed systems for both tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we continue experiments where neural machine translation training is used to produce joint cross-lingual fixed-dimensional sentence embeddings. In this framework we introduce a simple method of adding a loss to the learning objective which penalizes distance between representations of bilingually aligned sentences. We evaluate cross-lingual transfer using two approaches, cross-lingual similarity search on an aligned corpus (Europarl) and cross-lingual document classification on a recently published benchmark Reuters corpus, and we find the similarity loss significantly improves performance on both. Furthermore, we notice that while our Reuters results are very competitive, our English results are not as competitive, showing room for improvement in the current cross-lingual state-ofthe-art. Our results are based on a set of 6 European languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>While recurrent neural networks have found success in a variety of natural language processing applications, they are general models of sequential data. We investigate how the properties of natural language data affect an LSTM's ability to learn a nonlinguistic task: recalling elements from its input. We find that models trained on natural language data are able to recall tokens from much longer sequences than models trained on non-language sequential data. Furthermore, we show that the LSTM learns to solve the memorization task by explicitly using a subset of its neurons to count timesteps in the input. We hypothesize that the patterns and structure in natural language data enable LSTMs to learn by providing approximate ways of reducing loss, but understanding the effect of different training data on the learnability of LSTMs remains an open question.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this study, we compare token representations constructed from visual features (i.e., pixels) with standard lookup-based embeddings. Our goal is to gain insight about the challenges of encoding a text representation from low-level features, e.g. from characters or pixels. We focus on Chinese, which&#8211;-as a logographic language&#8211;-has properties that make a representation via visual features challenging and interesting. To train and evaluate different models for the token representation, we chose the task of character-based neural machine translation (NMT) from Chinese to English. We found that a token representation computed only from visual features can achieve competitive results to lookup embeddings. However, we also show different strengths and weaknesses in the models' performance in a part-of-speech tagging task and also a semantic similarity task. In summary, we show that it is possible to achieve a ėxtit{text representation} only from pixels. We hope that this is a useful stepping stone for future studies that exclusively rely on visual input, or aim at exploiting visual features of written language.</abstract>

    <abstract>Learning representations for knowledge base entities and concepts is becoming increasingly important for NLP applications. However, recent entity embedding methods have relied on structured resources that are expensive to create for new domains and corpora. We present a distantly-supervised method for jointly learning embeddings of entities and text from an unnanotated corpus, using only a list of mappings between entities and surface forms. We learn embeddings from open-domain and biomedical corpora, and compare against prior methods that rely on human-annotated text or large knowledge graph structure. Our embeddings capture entity similarity and relatedness better than prior work, both in existing biomedical datasets and a new Wikipedia-based dataset that we release to the community. Results on analogy completion and entity sense disambiguation indicate that entities and words capture complementary information that can be effectively combined for downstream use.</abstract>

    <abstract>We explore a novel approach for Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) by casting it as a sequence-to-sequence process. We employ an attention-based model enriched with a copying mechanism to ensure faithful regeneration of the input sequence, while enabling interleaved generation of argument role labels. We apply this model in a monolingual setting, performing PropBank SRL on English language data. The constrained sequence generation set-up enforced with the copying mechanism allows us to analyze the performance and special properties of the model on manually labeled data and benchmarking against state-of-the-art sequence labeling models. We show that our model is able to solve the SRL argument labeling task on English data, yet further structural decoding constraints will need to be added to make the model truly competitive. Our work represents the first step towards more advanced, generative SRL labeling setups.</abstract>

    <abstract>The notions of concreteness and imageability, traditionally important in psycholinguistics, are gaining significance in semantic-oriented natural language processing tasks. In this paper we investigate the predictability of these two concepts via supervised learning, using word embeddings as explanatory variables. We perform predictions both within and across languages by exploiting collections of cross-lingual embeddings aligned to a single vector space. We show that the notions of concreteness and imageability are highly predictable both within and across languages, with a moderate loss of up to 20% in correlation when predicting across languages. We further show that the cross-lingual transfer via word embeddings is more efficient than the simple transfer via bilingual dictionaries.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents a dataset and supervised classification approach for economic event detection in English news articles. Currently, the economic domain is lacking resources and methods for data-driven supervised event detection. The detection task is conceived as a sentence-level classification task for 10 different economic event types. Two different machine learning approaches were tested: a rich feature set Support Vector Machine (SVM) set-up and a word-vector-based long short-term memory recurrent neural network (RNN-LSTM) set-up. We show satisfactory results for most event types, with the linear kernel SVM outperforming the other experimental set-ups</abstract>

        <abstract>Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the opinion expressed in text. Recently, it has been used to study behavioral finance, and in particular the effect of opinions and emotions on economic or financial decisions. In this paper, we use a public dataset of labeled tweets that has been labeled by Amazon Mechanical Turk and then we propose a baseline classification model. Then, by using Granger causality of both sentiment datasets with the different stocks, we shows that there is causality between social media and stock market returns (in both directions) for many stocks. Finally, We evaluate this causality analysis by showing that in the event of a specific news on certain dates, there are evidences of trending the same news on Twitter for that stock.</abstract>

This corpus is composed of corporate annual and social responsibility reports of the top 30 US, UK and German companies in the major (DJIA, FTSE 100, DAX), middle-sized (S and P 500, FTSE 250, MDAX) and technology (NASDAQ, FTSE AIM 100, TECDAX) stock indices, respectively. Altogether, this adds up to 5,000 reports from 270 companies headquartered in three of the world’s most important economies. The corpus spans a time frame from 2000 up to 2015 and contains, in total, 282M tokens. We also feature JOCo in a small-scale experiment to demonstrate its potential for NLP-fueled studies in economics, business and management research.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we use NLP techniques to detect linguistic uncertainty in financial disclosures. Leveraging general-domain and domain-specific word embedding models, we automatically expand an existing dictionary of uncertainty triggers. We furthermore examine how an expert filtering affects the quality of such an expansion. We show that the dictionary expansions significantly improve regressions on stock return volatility. Lastly, we prove that the expansions significantly boost the automatic detection of uncertain sentences.</abstract>

        <abstract>When evaluating a potential product purchase, customers may have many questions in mind. They want to get adequate information to determine whether the product of interest is worth their money. In this paper we present a simple deep learning model for answering questions regarding product facts and specifications. Given a question and a product specification, the model outputs a score indicating their relevance. To train and evaluate our proposed model, we collected a dataset of 7,119 questions that are related to 153 different products. Experimental results demonstrate that &#8211;despite its simplicity&#8211; the performance of our model is shown to be comparable to a more complex state-of-the-art baseline.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the last years, compliance requirements for the banking sector have greatly augmented, making the current compliance processes difficult to maintain. Any process that allows to accelerate the identification and implementation of compliance requirements can help address this issues. The contributions of the paper are twofold: we propose a new NLP task that is the investment rule detection, and a group of methods identify them. We show that the proposed methods are highly performing and fast, thus can be deployed in production.</abstract>

        <abstract>With the rising popularity of social media in the society and in research, analysing texts short in length, such as microblogs, becomes an increasingly important task. As a medium of communication, microblogs carry peoples sentiments and express them to the public. Given that sentiments are driven by multiple factors including the news media, the question arises if the sentiment expressed in news and the news article themselves can be leveraged to detect and classify sentiment in microblogs. Prior research has highlighted the impact of sentiments and opinions on the market dynamics, making the financial domain a prime case study for this approach. Therefore, this paper describes ongoing research dealing with the exploitation of news contained sentiment to improve microblog sentiment classification in a financial context.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper focuses on aspect extraction which is a sub-task of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. The goal is to report an extraction method of financial aspects in microblog messages. Our approach uses a stock-investment taxonomy for the identification of explicit and implicit aspects. We compare supervised and unsupervised methods to assign predefined categories at message level. Results on 7 aspect classes show 0.71 accuracy, while the 32 class classification gives 0.82 accuracy for messages containing explicit aspects and 0.35 for implicit aspects.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we propose a new unsuper- vised learning framework to use news events for predicting trends in stock prices. We present Word Influencer Networks (WIN), a graph framework to extract longitudinal tem- poral relationships between any pair of infor- mative words from news streams. Using the temporal occurrence of words, WIN measures how the appearance of one word in a news stream influences the emergence of another set of words in the future. The latent word-word influencer relationships in WIN are the build- ing blocks for causal reasoning and predic- tive modeling. We demonstrate the efficacy of WIN by using it for unsupervised extraction of latent features for stock price prediction and obtain 2 orders lower prediction error com- pared to a similar causal graph based method. WIN discovered influencer links from seem- ingly unrelated words from topics like poli- tics to finance. WIN also validated 67% of the causal evidence found manually in the text through a direct edge and the rest 33% through a path of length 2.</abstract>

        <abstract>Code-switching is the fluent alternation between two or more languages in conversation between bilinguals. Large populations of speakers code-switch during communication, but little effort has been made to develop tools for code-switching, including part-of-speech taggers. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS tagging of code-switched English-Spanish data based on recurrent neural networks. We test our model on known monolingual benchmarks to demonstrate that our neural POS tagging model is on par with state-of-the-art methods. We next test our code-switched methods on the Miami Bangor corpus of English Spanish conversation, focusing on two types of experiments: POS tagging alone, for which we achieve 96.34% accuracy, and joint part-of-speech and language ID tagging, which achieves similar POS tagging accuracy (96.39%) and very high language ID accuracy (98.78%). Finally, we show that our proposed models outperform other state-of-the-art code-switched taggers.</abstract>

        <abstract>Speakers in multilingual communities often switch between or mix multiple languages in the same conversation. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) of code-switched speech faces many challenges including the influence of phones of different languages on each other. This paper shows evidence that phone sharing between languages improves the Acoustic Model performance for Hindi-English code-switched speech. We compare baseline system built with separate phones for Hindi and English with systems where the phones were manually merged based on linguistic knowledge. Encouraged by the improved ASR performance after manually merging the phones, we further investigate multiple data-driven methods to identify phones to be merged across the languages. We show detailed analysis of automatic phone merging in this language pair and the impact it has on individual phone accuracies and WER. Though the best performance gain of 1.2% WER was observed with manually merged phones, we show experimentally that the manual phone merge is not optimal.</abstract>

        <abstract>We explore the effect of injecting background knowledge to different deep neural network (DNN) configurations in order to mitigate the problem of the scarcity of annotated data when applying these models on datasets of low-resourced languages. The background knowledge is encoded in the form of lexicons and pre-trained sub-word embeddings. The DNN models are evaluated on the task of detecting code-switching and borrowing points in non-standardised user-generated Algerian texts. Overall results show that DNNs benefit from adding background knowledge. However, the gain varies between models and categories. The proposed DNN architectures are generic and could be applied to other low-resourced languages.</abstract>

        <abstract>Code-Mixing (CM) is the phenomenon of alternating between two or more languages which is prevalent in bi- and multi-lingual communities. Most NLP applications today are still designed with the assumption of a single interaction language and are most likely to break given a CM utterance with multiple languages mixed at a morphological, phrase or sentence level. For example, popular commercial search engines do not yet fully understand the intents expressed in CM queries. As a first step towards fostering research which supports CM in NLP applications, we systematically crowd-sourced and curated an evaluation dataset for factoid question answering in three CM languages - Hinglish (Hindi+English), Tenglish (Telugu+English) and Tamlish (Tamil+English) which belong to two language families (Indo-Aryan and Dravidian). We share the details of our data collection process, techniques which were used to avoid inducing lexical bias amongst the crowd workers and other CM specific linguistic properties of the dataset. Our final dataset, which is available freely for research purposes, has 1,694 Hinglish, 2,848 Tamlish and 1,391 Tenglish factoid questions and their answers. We discuss the techniques used by the participants for the first edition of this ongoing challenge.</abstract>

        <abstract>Humans can learn multiple languages. If they know a fact in one language, they can answer a question in another language they understand. They can also answer Code-mix (CM) questions: questions which contain both languages. This behavior is attributed to the unique learning ability of humans. Our task aims to study if machines can achieve this. We demonstrate how effectively a machine can answer CM questions. In this work, we adopt a two phase approach: candidate generation and candidate re-ranking to answer questions. We propose a Triplet-Siamese-Hybrid CNN (TSHCNN) to re-rank candidate answers. We show experiments on the SimpleQuestions dataset. Our network is trained only on English questions provided in this dataset and noisy Hindi translations of these questions and can answer English-Hindi CM questions effectively without the need of translation into English. Back-transliterated CM questions outperform their lexical and sentence level translated counterparts by 5% and 35% in accuracy respectively, highlighting the efficacy of our approach in a resource constrained setting.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we detail our work on comparing different word-level language identification systems for code-switched Hindi-English data and a standard Spanish-English dataset. In this regard, we build a new code-switched dataset for Hindi-English. To understand the code-switching patterns in these language pairs, we investigate different code-switching metrics. We find that the CRF model outperforms the neural network based models by a margin of 2-5 percentage points for Spanish-English and 3-5 percentage points for Hindi-English.</abstract>

        <abstract>Lack of text data has been the major issue on code-switching language modeling. In this paper, we introduce multi-task learning based language model which shares syntax representation of languages to leverage linguistic information and tackle the low resource data issue. Our model jointly learns both language modeling and Part-of-Speech tagging on code-switched utterances. In this way, the model is able to identify the location of code-switching points and improves the prediction of next word. Our approach outperforms standard LSTM based language model, with an improvement of 9.7% and 7.4% in perplexity on SEAME Phase I and Phase II dataset respectively. Author4Affiliation</abstract>

        <abstract>One language is often assumed to be dominant in code-switching but this assumption has not been empirically tested. We operationalize the matrix language (ML) at the level of the sentence, using three common definitions from linguistics. We test whether these converge and then model this convergence via a set of metrics that together quantify the nature of C-S. We conduct our experiment on four Spanish-English corpora. Our results demonstrate that our model can separate some corpora according to whether they have a dominant ML or not but that the corpora span a range of mixing types that cannot be sorted neatly into an insertional vs. alternational dichotomy.</abstract>

        <abstract>Multilingual speakers switch between languages in an non-trivial fashion displaying inter sentential, intra sentential, and congruent lexicalization based transitions. While monolingual ASR systems may be capable of recognizing a few words from a foreign language, they are usually not robust enough to handle these varied styles of code-switching. There is also a lack of large code-switched speech corpora capturing all these styles making it difficult to build code-switched speech recognition systems. We hypothesize that it may be useful for an ASR system to be able to first detect the switching style of a particular utterance from acoustics, and then use specialized language models or other adaptation techniques for decoding the speech. In this paper, we look at the first problem of detecting code-switching style from acoustics. We classify code-switched Spanish-English and Hindi-English corpora using two metrics and show that features extracted from acoustics alone can distinguish between different kinds of code-switching in these language pairs.</abstract>

        <abstract>Bilingual speakers often freely mix languages. However, in such bilingual conversations, are the language choices of the speakers coordinated? How much does one speaker's choice of language affect other speakers? In this paper, we formulate code-choice as a linguistic style, and show that speakers are indeed sensitive to and accommodating of each other's code-choice. We find that the saliency or markedness of a language in context directly affects the degree of accommodation observed. More importantly, we discover that accommodation of code-choices persists over several conversational turns. We also propose an alternative interpretation of conversational accommodation as a retrieval problem, and show that the differences in accommodation characteristics of code-choices are based on their markedness in context.</abstract>

        <abstract>Code-switching (CS), the practice of alternating between two or more languages in conversations, is pervasive in most multi-lingual communities. CS texts have a complex interplay between languages and occur in informal contexts that make them harder to collect and construct NLP tools for. We approach this problem through Language Modeling (LM) on a new Hindi-English mixed corpus containing 59,189 unique sentences collected from blogging websites. We implement and discuss different Language Models derived from a multi-layered LSTM architecture. We hypothesize that encoding language information strengthens a language model by helping to learn code-switching points. We show that our highest performing model achieves a test perplexity of 19.52 on the CS corpus that we collected and processed. On this data we demonstrate that our performance is an improvement over AWD-LSTM LM (a recent state of the art on monolingual English).</abstract>

        <abstract>In this work, we address the problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-switched tweets as a part of the Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code-switching (CALCS) at ACL'18. Code-switching is the phenomenon where a speaker switches between two languages or variants of the same language within or across utterances, known as intra-sentential or inter-sentential code-switching, respectively. Processing such data is challenging using state of the art methods since such technology is generally geared towards processing monolingual text. In this paper we explored ways to use language identification and translation to recognize named entities in such data, however, utilizing simple features (sans multi-lingual features) with Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier achieved the best results. Our experiments were mainly aimed at the (ENG-SPA) English-Spanish dataset but we submitted a language-independent version of our system to the (MSA-EGY) Arabic-Egyptian dataset as well and achieved good results.</abstract>

        <abstract>We propose an LSTM-based model with hierarchical architecture on named entity recognition from code-switching Twitter data. Our model uses bilingual character representation and transfer learning to address out-of-vocabulary words. In order to mitigate data noise, we propose to use token replacement and normalization. In the 3rd Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code-Switching Shared Task, we achieved second place with 62.76% harmonic mean F1-score for English-Spanish language pair without using any gazetteer and knowledge-based information.

        <abstract>Named Entity Recognition is an important information extraction task that identifies proper names in unstructured texts and classifies them into some pre-defined categories. Identification of named entities in code-mixed social media texts is a more difficult and challenging task as the contexts are short, ambiguous and often noisy. This work proposes a Conditional Random Fields based named entity recognition system to identify proper names in code-switched data and classify them into nine categories. The system ranked fifth among nine participant systems and achieved a 59.25% F1-score.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes the system for the Named Entity Recognition Shared Task of the Third Workshop on Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code-Switching (CALCS) submitted by the Bilingual Annotations Tasks (BATs) research group of the University of Texas. Our system uses several features to train a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for classifying input words as Named Entities (NEs) using the Inside-Outside-Beginning (IOB) tagging scheme. We participated in the Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian Arabic (MSA-EGY) and English-Spanish (ENG-SPA) tasks, achieving weighted average F-scores of 65.62 and 54.16 respectively. We also describe the performance of a deep neural network (NN) trained on a subset of the CRF features, which did not surpass CRF performance.</abstract>

        <abstract>Named Entity Recognition plays a major role in several downstream applications in NLP. Though this task has been heavily studied in formal monolingual texts and also noisy texts like Twitter data, it is still an emerging task in code-switched (CS) content on social media. This paper describes our participation in the shared task of NER on code-switched data for Spanglish (Spanish + English) and Arabish (Arabic + English). In this paper we describe models that intuitively developed from the data for the shared task Named Entity Recognition on Code-switched Data. Owing to the sparse and non-linear relationships between words in Twitter data, we explored neural architectures that are capable of non-linearities fairly well. In specific, we trained character level models and word level models based on Bidirectional LSTMs (Bi-LSTMs) to perform sequential tagging. We train multiple models to identify nominal mentions and subsequently use this information to predict the labels of named entity in a sequence. Our best model is a character level model along with word level pre-trained multilingual embeddings that gave an F-score of 56.72 in Spanglish and a word level model that gave an F-score of 65.02 in Arabish on the test data.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the third shared task of the Computational Approaches to Linguistic Code-Switching (CALCS) workshop, we focus on Named Entity Recognition (NER) on code-switched social-media data. We divide the shared task into two competitions based on the English-Spanish (ENG-SPA) and Modern Standard Arabic-Egyptian (MSA-EGY) language pairs. We use Twitter data and 9 entity types to establish a new dataset for code-switched NER benchmarks. In addition to the CS phenomenon, the diversity of the entities and the social media challenges make the task considerably hard to process. As a result, the best scores of the competitions are 63.76\% and 71.61\% for ENG-SPA and MSA-EGY, respectively. We present the scores of 9 participants and discuss the most common challenges among submissions.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the last decade, video blogs (vlogs) have become an extremely popular method through which people express sentiment. The ubiquitousness of these videos has increased the importance of multimodal fusion models, which incorporate video and audio features with traditional text features for automatic sentiment detection. Multimodal fusion offers a unique opportunity to build models that learn from the full depth of expression available to human viewers. In the detection of sentiment in these videos, acoustic and video features provide clarity to otherwise ambiguous transcripts. In this paper, we present a multimodal fusion model that exclusively uses high-level video and audio features to analyze spoken sentences for sentiment. We discard traditional transcription features in order to minimize human intervention and to maximize the deployability of our model on at-scale real-world data. We select high-level features for our model that have been successful in non-affect domains in order to test their generalizability in the sentiment detection domain. We train and test our model on the newly released CMU Multimodal Opinion Sentiment and Emotion Intensity (CMU-MOSEI) dataset, obtaining an F1 score of 0.8049 on the validation set and an F1 score of 0.6325 on the held-out challenge test set.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present our system description of input-level multimodal fusion of audio, video, and text for recognition of emotions and their intensities for the 2018 First Grand Challenge on Computational Modeling of Human Multimodal Language. Our proposed approach is based on input-level feature fusion with sequence learning from Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BLSTM) deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that our fusion approach outperforms unimodal predictors. Our system performs 6-way simultaneous classification and regression, allowing for overlapping emotion labels in a video segment. This leads to an overall binary accuracy of 90\%, overall 4-class accuracy of 89.2\% and an overall mean-absolute-error (MAE) of 0.12. Our work shows that an early fusion technique can effectively predict the presence of multi-label emotions as well as their coarse-grained intensities. The presented multimodal approach creates a simple and robust baseline on this new Grand Challenge dataset. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of emotion intensity distributions as output from our DNN, as well as a related discussion concerning the inherent difficulty of this task.</abstract>

        <abstract>Understanding Affect from video segments has brought researchers from the language, audio and video domains together. Most of the current multimodal research in this area deals with various techniques to fuse the modalities, and mostly treat the segments of a video independently. Motivated by the work of (Zadeh et al., 2017) and (Poria et al., 2017), we present our architecture, Relational Tensor Network, where we use the inter-modal interactions within a segment (intra-segment) and also consider the sequence of segments in a video to model the inter-segment inter-modal interactions. We also generate rich representations of text and audio modalities by leveraging richer audio and linguistic context alongwith fusing fine-grained knowledge based polarity scores from text. We present the results of our model on CMU-MOSEI dataset and show that our model outperforms many baselines and state of the art methods for sentiment classification and emotion recognition.</abstract>

        <abstract>Emotion recognition has become a popular topic of interest, especially in the field of human computer interaction. Previous works involve unimodal analysis of emotion, while recent efforts focus on multimodal emotion recognition from vision and speech. In this paper, we propose a new method of learning about the hidden representations between just speech and text data using convolutional attention networks. Compared to the shallow model which employs simple concatenation of feature vectors, the proposed attention model performs much better in classifying emotion from speech and text data contained in the CMU-MOSEI dataset.</abstract>

        <abstract>Multimodal sentiment classification in practical applications may have to rely on erroneous and imperfect views, namely (a) language transcription from a speech recognizer and (b) under-performing acoustic views. This work focuses on improving the representations of these views by performing a deep canonical correlation analysis with the representations of the better performing manual transcription view. Enhanced representations of the imperfect views can be obtained even in absence of the perfect views and give an improved performance during test conditions. Evaluations on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</abstract>

        <abstract>Current multimodal sentiment analysis frames sentiment score prediction as a general Machine Learning task. However, what the sentiment score actually represents has often been overlooked. As a measurement of opinions and affective states, a sentiment score generally consists of two aspects: polarity and intensity. We decompose sentiment scores into these two aspects and study how they are conveyed through individual modalities and combined multimodal models in a naturalistic monologue setting. In particular, we build unimodal and multimodal multi-task learning models with sentiment score prediction as the main task and polarity and/or intensity classification as the auxiliary tasks. Our experiments show that sentiment analysis benefits from multi-task learning, and individual modalities differ when conveying the polarity and intensity aspects of sentiment.</abstract>

        <abstract>During the last decade, the applications of signal processing have drastically improved with deep learning. However areas of affecting computing such as emotional speech synthesis or emotion recognition from spoken language remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate the use of a neural Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) as a feature extractor for emotion recognition. We show that these features outperform the eGeMAPS feature set to predict the valence and arousal emotional dimensions, which means that the audio-to-text mapping learned by the ASR system contains information related to the emotional dimensions in spontaneous speech. We also examine the relationship between first layers (closer to speech) and last layers (closer to text) of the ASR and valence/arousal.</abstract>

        <abstract>Multimodal machine learning is a core research area spanning the language, visual and acoustic modalities. The central challenge in multimodal learning involves learning representations that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose two methods for unsupervised learning of joint multimodal representations using sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) methods: a Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model and a Hierarchical Seq2Seq Modality Translation Model. We also explore multiple different variations on the multimodal inputs and outputs of these seq2seq models. Our experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSI dataset indicate that our methods learn informative multimodal representations that outperform the baselines and achieve improved performance on multimodal sentiment analysis, specifically in the Bimodal case where our model is able to improve F1 Score by twelve points. We also discuss future directions for multimodal Seq2Seq methods.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present our work on sentiment prediction using the benchmark MOSI dataset from the CMU-MultimodalDataSDK. Previous work on multimodal sentiment analysis have been focused on input-level feature fusion or decision-level fusion for multimodal fusion. Here, we propose an intermediate-level feature fusion, which merges weights from each modality (audio, video, and text) during training with subsequent additional training. Moreover, we tested principle component analysis (PCA) for feature selection. We found that applying PCA increases unimodal performance, and multimodal fusion outperforms unimodal models. Our experiments show that our proposed intermediate-level feature fusion outperforms other fusion techniques, and it achieves the best performance with an overall binary accuracy of 74.0\% on video+text modalities. Our work also improves feature selection for unimodal sentiment analysis, while proposing a novel and effective multimodal fusion architecture for this task.</abstract>

        <abstract>Neural part-of-speech (POS) taggers are known to not perform well with little training data. As a step towards overcoming this problem, we present an architecture for learning more robust neural POS taggers by jointly training a hierarchical, recurrent model and a recurrent character-based sequence-to-sequence network supervised using an auxiliary objective. This way, we introduce stronger character-level supervision into the model, which enables better generalization to unseen words and provides regularization, making our encoding less prone to overfitting. We experiment with three auxiliary tasks: lemmatization, character-based word autoencoding, and character-based random string autoencoding. Experiments with minimal amounts of labeled data on 34 languages show that our new architecture outperforms a single-task baseline and, sur- prisingly, that, on average, raw text autoencoding can be as beneficial for low-resource POS tagging as using lemma information. Our neural POS tagger closes the gap to a state-of-the-art POS tagger (MarMoT) for low-resource scenarios by 43%, even outperforming it on languages with templatic morphology, e.g., Arabic, Hebrew, and Turkish, by some margin.</abstract>

        <abstract>Manually labeled corpora are expensive to create and often not available for low-resource languages or domains. Automatic labeling approaches are an alternative way to obtain labeled data in a quicker and cheaper way. However, these labels often contain more errors which can deteriorate a classifier's performance when trained on this data. We propose a noise layer that is added to a neural network architecture. This allows modeling the noise and train on a combination of clean and noisy data. We show that in a low-resource NER task we can improve performance by up to 35% by using additional, noisy data and handling the noise.</abstract>

        <abstract>Historical text normalization suffers from small datasets that exhibit high variance, and previous work has shown that multi-task learning can be used to leverage data from related problems in order to obtain more robust models. Previous work has been limited to datasets from a specific language and a specific historical period, and it is not clear whether results generalize. It therefore remains an open problem, when historical text normalization benefits from multi-task learning. We explore the benefits of multi-task learning across 10 different datasets, representing different languages and periods. Our main finding&#8212;contrary to what has been observed for other NLP tasks&#8212;is that multi-task learning mainly works when target task data is very scarce.</abstract>

        <abstract>Icon-based communication systems are widely used in the field of Augmentative and Alternative Communication. Typically, icon-based systems have lagged behind word- and character-based systems in terms of predictive typing functionality, due to the challenges inherent to training icon-based language models. We propose a method for synthesizing training data for use in icon-based language models, and explore two different modeling strategies. We propose a method to generate language models for corpus-less symbol-set.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of training a multimodal neu- ral machine translation (MNMT) system with image features for a low-resource language pair, Hindi and English, using synthetic data. A three-way parallel corpus which contains bilingual texts and corresponding images is required to train a MNMT system with image features. However, such a corpus is not available for low resource language pairs. To address this, we developed both a synthetic training dataset and a manually curated development/test dataset for Hindi based on an existing English-image parallel corpus. We used these datasets to build our image description translation system by adopting state-of-the-art MNMT models. Our results show that it is possible to train a MNMT system for low-resource language pairs through the use of synthetic data and that such a system can benefit from image features.</abstract>

        <abstract>Most Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) approaches are supervised methods which require a significant amount of annotated corpus, and the annotation requires linguistic expertise. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Active Learning framework for Semantic Role Labeling with Entity Recognition (ER) as the auxiliary task to alleviate the need for extensive data and use additional information from ER to help SRL. We evaluate our approach on Indonesian conversational dataset. Our experiments show that multi-task active learning can outperform single-task active learning method and standard multi-task learning. According to our results, active learning is more efficient by using 12% less of training data compared to passive learning in both single-task and multi-task setting. We also introduce a new dataset for SRL in Indonesian conversational domain to encourage further research in this area.</abstract>

        <abstract>Generic word embeddings are trained on large-scale generic corpora; Domain Specific (DS) word embeddings are trained only on data from a domain of interest. This paper proposes a method to combine the breadth of generic embeddings with the specificity of domain specific embeddings. The resulting embeddings, called Domain Adapted (DA) word embeddings, are formed by first aligning corresponding word vectors using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or the related nonlinear Kernel CCA (KCCA) and then combining them via convex optimization. Results from evaluation on sentiment classification tasks show that the DA embeddings substantially outperform both generic, DS embeddings when used as input features to standard or state-of-the-art sentence encoding algorithms for classification.</abstract>

        <abstract>Fine-tuning is a popular method to achieve better performance when only a small target corpus is available. However, it requires tuning of a number of metaparameters and thus it might carry risk of adverse effect when inappropriate metaparameters are used. Therefore, we investigate effective parameters for fine-tuning when only a small target corpus is available. In the current study, we target at improving Japanese word embeddings created from a huge corpus. First, we demonstrate that even the word embeddings created from the huge corpus are affected by domain shift. After that, we investigate effective parameters for fine-tuning of the word embeddings using a small target corpus. We used perplexity of a language model obtained from a Long Short-Term Memory network to assess the word embeddings input into the network. The experiments revealed that fine-tuning sometimes give adverse effect when only a small target corpus is used and batch size is the most important parameter for fine-tuning. In addition, we confirmed that effect of fine-tuning is higher when size of a target corpus was larger.</abstract>

        <abstract>The lack of high-quality labeled training data has been one of the critical challenges facing many industrial machine learning tasks. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a semi-supervised learning method to utilize unlabeled data and user feedback signals to improve the performance of ML models. The method employs a primary model Main and an auxiliary evaluation model Eval, where Main and Eval models are trained iteratively by automatically generating labeled data from unlabeled data and/or users’ feedback signals. The proposed approach is applied to different text classification tasks. We report results on both the publicly available Yahoo! Answers dataset and our e-commerce product classification dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces the classification error rate by 4% and up to 15% across various experimental setups and datasets. A detailed comparison with other semi-supervised learning approaches is also presented later in the paper. The results from various text classification tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms those developed in previous related studies.</abstract>

        <abstract>Various common deep learning architectures, such as LSTMs, GRUs, Resnets and Highway Networks, employ state passthrough connections that support training with high feed-forward depth or recurrence over many time steps. These "Passthrough Networks" architectures also enable the decoupling of the network state size from the number of parameters of the network, a possibility has been studied by Sak et al. (2014) with their low-rank parametrization of the LSTM. In this work we extend this line of research, proposing effective, low-rank and low-rank plus diagonal matrix parametrizations for Passthrough Networks which exploit this decoupling property, reducing the data complexity and memory requirements of the network while preserving its memory capacity. This is particularly beneficial in low-resource settings as it supports expressive models with a compact parametrization less susceptible to overfitting. We present competitive experimental results on several tasks, including language modeling and a near state of the art result on sequential randomly-permuted MNIST classification, a hard task on natural data.</abstract>

        <abstract>Computational Humor involves several tasks, such as humor recognition, humor generation, and humor scoring, for which it is useful to have human-curated data. In this work we present a corpus of 27,000 tweets written in Spanish and crowd-annotated by their humor value and funniness score, with about four annotations per tweet, tagged by 1,300 people over the Internet. It is equally divided between tweets coming from humorous and non-humorous accounts. The inter-annotator agreement Krippendorff's alpha value is 0.5710. The dataset is available for general usage and can serve as a basis for humor detection and as a first step to tackle subjectivity.</abstract>

        <abstract>Code-mixing is a linguistic phenomenon where multiple languages are used in the same occurrence that is increasingly common in multilingual societies. Code-mixed content on social media is also on the rise, prompting the need for tools to automatically understand such content. Automatic Parts-of-Speech (POS) tagging is an essential step in any Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, but there is a lack of annotated data to train such models. In this work, we present a unique language tagged and POS-tagged dataset of code-mixed English-Hindi tweets related to five incidents in India that led to a lot of Twitter activity. Our dataset is unique in two dimensions: (i) it is larger than previous annotated datasets and (ii) it closely resembles typical real-world tweets. Additionally, we present a POS tagging model that is trained on this dataset to provide an example of how this dataset can be used. The model also shows the efficacy of our dataset in enabling the creation of code-mixed social media POS taggers.</abstract>

        <abstract>The exponential rise of social media websites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit in linguistically diverse geographical regions has led to hybridization of popular native languages with English in an effort to ease communication. The paper focuses on the classification of offensive tweets written in Hinglish language, which is a portmanteau of the Indic language Hindi with the Roman script. The paper introduces a novel tweet dataset, titled Hindi-English Offensive Tweet (HEOT) dataset, consisting of tweets in Hindi-English code switched language split into three classes: non-offensive, abusive and hate-speech. Further, we approach the problem of classification of the tweets in HEOT dataset using transfer learning wherein the proposed model employing Convolutional Neural Networks is pre-trained on tweets in English followed by retraining on Hinglish tweets.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes an overview of the Dialogue Emotion Recognition Challenge, EmotionX, at the Sixth SocialNLP Workshop, which recognizes the emotion of each utterance in dialogues. This challenge offers the EmotionLines dataset as the experimental materials. The EmotionLines dataset contains conversations from Friends TV show transcripts (Friends) and real chatting logs (EmotionPush), where every dialogue utterance is labeled with emotions. Organizers provide baseline results. 18 teams registered in this challenge and 5 of them submitted their results successfully. The best team achieves the unweighted accuracy 62.48 and 62.5 on EmotionPush and Friends, respectively. In this paper we present the task definition, test collection, the evaluation results of the groups that participated in this challenge, and their approach.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we propose a self-attentive bidirectional long short-term memory (SA-BiLSTM) network to predict multiple emotions for the EmotionX challenge. The BiLSTM exhibits the power of modeling the word dependencies, and extracting the most relevant features for emotion classification. Building on top of BiLSTM, the self-attentive network can model the contextual dependencies between utterances which are helpful for classifying the ambiguous emotions. We achieve 59.6 and 55.0 unweighted accuracy scores in the Friends and the EmotionPush test sets, respectively.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents our system submitted to the EmotionX challenge. It is an emotion detection task on dialogues in the EmotionLines dataset. We formulate this as a hierarchical network where network learns data representation at both utterance level and dialogue level. Our model is inspired by Hierarchical Attention network (HAN) and uses pre-trained word embeddings as features. We formulate emotion detection in dialogues as a sequence labeling problem to capture the dependencies among labels. We report the performance accuracy for four emotions (anger, joy, neutral and sadness). The model achieved unweighted accuracy of 55.38\% on Friends test dataset and 56.73\% on EmotionPush test dataset. We report an improvement of 22.51\% in Friends dataset and 36.04\% in EmotionPush dataset over baseline results.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper addresses the problem of automatic recognition of emotions in conversational text datasets for the EmotionX challenge. Emotion is a human characteristic expressed through several modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, tactile). Trying to detect emotions only from the text becomes a difficult task even for humans. This paper evaluates several neural architectures based on Attention Models, which allow extracting relevant parts of the context within a conversation to identify the emotion associated with each utterance. Empirical results in the validation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach compared to the reference models for some instances, and other cases show better results with simpler models.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we discuss the enrichment of a manually developed resource, OntoSenseNet for Telugu. OntoSenseNet is a sense annotated resource that marks each verb of Telugu with a primary and a secondary sense. The area of research is relatively recent but has a large scope of development. We provide an introductory work to enrich the OntoSenseNet to promote further research in Telugu. Classifiers are adopted to learn the sense relevant features of the words in the resource and also to automate the tagging of sense-types for verbs. We perform a comparative analysis of different classifiers applied on OntoSenseNet.

        <abstract>A large amount of social media data is generated during natural disasters, and identifying the relevant portions of this data is critical for researchers attempting to understand human behavior, the effects of information sources, and preparatory actions undertaken during these events. In order to classify human behavior during hazard events, we employ machine learning for two tasks: identifying hurricane related tweets and classifying user evacuation behavior during hurricanes. We show that feature-based and deep learning methods provide different benefits for tweet classification, and ensemble-based methods using linguistic, temporal, and geospatial features can effectively classify user behavior.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this study we propose a new approach to analyse the political discourse in on-line social networks such as Twitter. To do so, we have built a discourse classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks. Our model has been trained using election manifestos annotated manually by political scientists following the Regional Manifestos Project (RMP) methodology. In total, it has been trained with more than 88,000 sentences extracted from more that 100 annotated manifestos. Our approach takes into account the context of the phrase in order to classify it, like what was previously said and the political affiliation of the transmitter. To improve the classification results we have used a simplified political message taxonomy developed within the Electronic Regional Manifestos Project (E-RMP). Using this taxonomy, we have validated our approach analysing the Twitter activity of the main Spanish political parties during 2015 and 2016 Spanish general election and providing a study of their discourse.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report results from the SR’18 Shared Task, a new multilingual surface realisation task organised as part of the ACL’18 Workshop on Multilingual Surface Realisation. As in its English-only predecessor task SR’11, the shared task comprised two tracks with different levels of complexity: (a) a shallow track where the inputs were full UD structures with word order information removed and tokens lemmatised; and (b) a deep track where additionally, functional words and morphological information were removed. The shallow track was offered in ten, and the deep track in three languages. Systems were evaluated (a) automatically, using a range of intrinsic metrics, and (b) by human judges in terms of readability and meaning similarity. This report presents the evaluation results, along with descriptions of the SR’18 tracks, data and evaluation methods. For full descriptions of the participating systems, please see the separate system reports elsewhere in this volume.</abstract>

        <abstract>Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 is a workshop on generating sentences from lemmatized sets of dependency triples. This paper describes the results of our participation in the challenge. We develop a data-driven pipeline system which first orders the lemmas and then conjugates the words to finish the surface realization process. Our contribution is a novel sequential method of ordering lemmas, which, despite its simplicity, achieves promising results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, describe its limitations and outline ways to improve it.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes our submission system for the Shallow Track of Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 (SRST'18). The task was to convert genuine UD structures, from which word order information had been removed and the tokens had been lemmatized, into their correct sentential form. We divide the problem statement into two parts, word reinflection and correct word order prediction. For the first sub-problem, we use a Long Short Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder approach. For the second sub-problem, we present a Language Model (LM) based approach. We apply two different sub-approaches in the LM Based approach and the combined result of these two approaches is considered as the final output of the system.</abstract>

        <abstract>This study describes the approach developed by the Tilburg University team to the shallow task of the Multilingual Surface Realization Shared Task 2018 (SR18). Based on (Castro Ferreira et al., 2017), the approach works by first preprocessing an input dependency tree into an ordered linearized string, which is then realized using a statistical machine translation model. Our approach shows promising results, with BLEU scores above 50 for 5 different languages (English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish) and above 35 for the Dutch language.</abstract>

        <abstract>Surface realization is a nontrivial task as it involves taking structured data and producing grammatically and semantically correct utterances. Many competing grammar-based and statistical models for realization still struggle with relatively simple sentences. For our submission to the 2018 Surface Realization Shared Task, we tackle the shallow task by first generating inflected wordforms with a neural sequence-to-sequence model before incrementally linearizing them. For linearization, we use a global linear model trained using early update that makes use of features that take into account the dependency structure and dependency locality. Using this pipeline sufficed to produce surprisingly strong results in the shared task. In future work, we intend to pursue joint approaches to linearization and morphological inflection and incorporating a neural language model into the linearization choices.</abstract>

        <abstract>This work presents state of the art results in reconstruction of surface realizations from obfuscated text. We identify the lack of sufficient training data as the major obstacle to training high-performing models, and solve this issue by generating large amounts of synthetic training data. We also propose preprocessing techniques which make the structure contained in the input features more accessible to sequence models. Our models were ranked first on all evaluation metrics in the English portion of the 2018 Surface Realization shared task.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes the submission by the NILC Computational Linguistics research group of the University of S ̃ao Paulo/Brazil to the Track 1 of the Surface Realization Shared Task (SRST Track 1). We present a neural-based method that works at the syntactic level to order the words (which we refer by NILC-SWORNEMO, standing for “Syntax-based Word ORdering using NEural MOdels”). Additionally, we apply a bottom-up approach to build the sentence and, using language-specific lexicons, we produce the proper word form of each lemma in the sentence. The results obtained by our method outperformed the average of the results for English, Portuguese and Spanish in the track.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper, we have proposed a technique for generating complex reading comprehension questions from a discourse that are more useful than factual ones derived from assertions. Our system produces a set of general-level questions using coherence relations and a set of well-defined syntactic transformations on the input text. Generated questions evaluate comprehension abilities like a comprehensive analysis of the text and its structure, correct identification of the author's intent, a thorough evaluation of stated arguments; and a deduction of the high-level semantic relations that hold between text spans. Experiments performed on the RST-DT corpus allow us to conclude that our system possesses a strong aptitude for generating intricate questions. These questions are capable of effectively assessing a student's interpretation of the text.</abstract>

        <abstract>Among the challenges of teaching reading comprehension in K &#8211; 12 are identifying the portions of a text that are difficult for a student, comprehending major critical ideas, and understanding context-dependent polysemous words. We present a simple, unsupervised but robust and accurate syntactic method for achieving the first objective and a modified hierarchical lexical method for the second objective. Focusing on pinpointing troublesome sentences instead of the overall readability and on concepts central to a reading, we believe these methods will greatly facilitate efforts to help students improve reading skills</abstract>

        <abstract>Advances in automatic readability assessment can impact the way people consume information in a number of domains. Arabic, being a low-resource and morphologically complex language, presents numerous challenges to the task of automatic readability assessment. In this paper, we present the largest and most in-depth computational readability study for Arabic to date. We study a large set of features with varying depths, from shallow words to syntactic trees, for both L1 and L2 readability tasks. Our best L1 readability accuracy result is 94.8% (75% error reduction from a commonly used baseline). The comparable results for L2 are 72.4% (45% error reduction). We also demonstrate the added value of leveraging L1 features for L2 readability prediction.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper investigates what differentiates effective tutorial sessions from less effective sessions. Towards this end, we characterize and explore human tutors' actions in tutorial dialogue sessions by mapping the tutor-tutee interactions, which are streams of dialogue utterances, into streams of actions, based on the language-as-action theory. Next, we use human expert judgment measures, evidence of learning (EL) and evidence of soundness (ES), to identify effective and ineffective sessions. We perform sub-sequence pattern mining to identify sub-sequences of dialogue modes that discriminate good sessions from bad sessions. We finally use the results of sub-sequence analysis method to generate a tutorial Markov process for effective tutorial sessions.</abstract>

        <abstract>Essays have two major components for scoring - content and style. In this paper, we describe a property of the essay, called goodness, and use it to predict the score given for the style of student essays. We compare our approach to solve this problem with baseline approaches, like language modeling and also a state-of-the-art deep learning system. We show that, despite being quite intuitive, our approach is very powerful in predicting the style of the essays.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes our system at NLPTEA-2018 Task &#35;1: Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis. Grammatical Error Diagnosis is one of the most challenging NLP tasks，which is to locate grammar errors and tell error types. Our system is built on the model of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory with a conditional random field layer (BiLSTM-CRF) but integrates with several new features. First, richer features are considered in the BiLSTM-CRF model; second, a probabilistic ensemble approach is adopted; third, Template Matcher are used during a post-processing to bring in human knowledge. In official evaluation, our system obtains the highest F1 scores at identifying error types and locating error positions, the second highest F1 score at sentence level error detection. We also recommend error corrections for specific error types and achieve the best F1 performance among all participants.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper introduces the DM_NLP team’s system for NLPTEA 2018 shared task of Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED), which can be used to detect and correct grammatical errors in texts written by Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) learners. This task aims at not only detecting four types of grammatical errors including redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word selection (S) and disordered words (W), but also recommending corrections for errors of M and S types. We proposed a hybrid system including four models for this task with two stages: the detection stage and the correction stage. In the detection stage, we first used a BiLSTM-CRF model to tag potential errors by sequence labeling, along with some handcraft features. Then we designed three Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) models to generate corrections, which could help to tune the detection result. In the correction stage, candidates were generated by the three GEC models and then merged to output the final corrections for M and S types. Our system reached the highest precision in the correction subtask, which was the most challenging part of this shared task, and got top 3 on F1 scores for position detection of errors.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this study, we employ the sequence to sequence learning to model the task of grammar error correction. The system takes potentially erroneous sentences as inputs, and outputs correct sentences. To breakthrough the bottlenecks of very limited size of manually labeled data, we adopt a semi-supervised approach. Specifically, we adapt correct sentences written by native Chinese speakers to generate pseudo grammatical errors made by learners of Chinese as a second language. We use the pseudo data to pre-train the model, and the CGED data to fine-tune it. Being aware of the significance of precision in a grammar error correction system in real scenarios, we use ensembles to boost precision. When using inputs as simple as Chinese characters, the ensembled system achieves a precision at 86.56% in the detection of erroneous sentences, and a precision at 51.53% in the correction of errors of Selection and Missing types.</abstract>

        <abstract>Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED) is a natural language processing task for the NLPTEA2018 workshop held during ACL2018. The goal of this task is to diagnose Chinese sentences containing four kinds of grammatical errors through the model and find out the sentence errors. Chinese grammatical error diagnosis system is a very important tool, which can help Chinese learners automatically diagnose grammatical errors in many scenarios. However, due to the limitations of the Chinese language's own characteristics and datasets, the traditional model faces the problem of extreme imbalances in the positive and negative samples and the disappearance of gradients. In this paper, we propose a sequence labeling method based on the Policy Gradient LSTM model and apply it to this task to solve the above problems. The results show that our model can achieve higher precision scores in the case of lower False positive rate (FPR) and it is convenient to optimize the model on-line.</abstract>

        <abstract>Verbal communication &#8212; and pronunciation as its part &#8212; is a core skill that can be developed through guided learning. An artificial intelligence system can take a role in these guided learning approaches as an enabler of an application for pronunciation learning with a recommender system to guide language learners through exercises and feedback system to correct their pronunciation. In this paper, we report on a user study on language learners' perceived usefulness of the application. 16 international students who spoke non-native English and lived in Australia participated. 13 of them said they need to improve their pronunciation skills in English because of their foreign accent. The feedback system with features for pronunciation scoring, speech replay, and giving a pronunciation example was deemed essential by most of the respondents. In contrast, a clear dichotomy between the recommender system perceived as useful or useless existed; the system had features to prompt new common words or old poorly-scored words. These results can be used to target research and development from information retrieval and reinforcement learning for better and better recommendations to speech recognition and speech analytics for accent acquisition.</abstract>

        <abstract>PerspectivesX is a multi-perspective elaboration tool designed to encourage learner submission and curation across a range of collaborative learning activities. In this paper, it is shown that the learning design objectives of collaborative learning activities can be evaluated using NLP techniques, but that careful analysis of learner impact and pedagogical intent are required in order to select appropriate techniques. In particular, this paper focuses on the NLP techniques required to deliver an instructor dashboard, personalized learner feedback and content recommendation within multi-perspective elaboration activities. Key NLP techniques considered for inclusion include summarization, topic modeling, paraphrase detection and diversified content recommendation.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper we present a qualitatively enhanced deep convolution recurrent neural network for computing the quality of a text in an automatic essay scoring task. The novelty of the work lies in the fact that instead of considering only the word and sentence representation of a text, we try to augment the different complex linguistic, cognitive and psycological features associated within a text document along with a hierarchical convolution recurrent neural network framework. Our preliminary investigation shows that incorporation of such qualitative feature vectors along with standard word/sentence embeddings can give us better understanding about improving the overall evaluation of the input essays.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper describes two models that employ word frequency embeddings to deal with the problem of readability assessment in multiple languages. The task is to determine the difficulty level of a given document, i.e., how hard it is for a reader to fully comprehend the text. The proposed models show how frequency information can be integrated to improve the readability assessment. The experimental results testing on both English and Chinese datasets show that the proposed models improve the results notably when comparing to those using only traditional word embeddings.</abstract>

It is aimed for easy integration into the traditional classroom setting and syllabus, which makes it distinct from other language learning tools that provide standalone learning experience. It uses grammar-based lessons and embraces methods of gamification to improve the learner motivation. The main type of exercise provided by our application is to practice translation, but it is also possible to shift the focus to vocabulary or morphology training.</abstract>

        <abstract>Childhood acquisition of written language is not straightforward. Writing skills evolve differently depending on external factors, such as the conditions in which children practice their productions and the quality of their instructors' guidance. This can be challenging in low-income areas, where schools may struggle to ensure ideal acquisition conditions. Developing computational tools to support the learning process may counterweight negative environmental influences; however, few work exists on the use of information technologies to improve childhood literacy. This work centers around the computational study of Spanish word and syllable structure in documents written by 2nd and 3rd year elementary school students. The studied texts were compared against a corpus of short stories aimed at the same age group, so as to observe whether the children tend to produce similar written patterns as the ones they are expected to interpret at their literacy level. The obtained results show some significant differences between the two kinds of texts, pointing towards possible strategies for the implementation of new education software in support of written language acquisition.</abstract>

        <abstract>This study assesses an index for measur-ing the pronunciation difficulty of sen-tences (henceforth, pronounceability) based on the normalized edit distance from a reference sentence to a transcrip-tion of learners’ pronunciation. Pro-nounceability should be examined when language teachers use a computer-assisted language learning system for pronunciation learning to maintain the motivation of learners. However, unlike the evaluation of learners’ pronunciation performance, previous research did not focus on pronounceability not only for English but also for Asian languages. This study found that the normalized edit distance was reliable but not valid. The lack of validity appeared to be because of an English test used for determining the proficiency of learners.</abstract>

        <abstract>We systematically confirm that instructors are strongly influenced by the user interface presentation of Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) discussion forums. In a large scale dataset, we conclusively show that instructor interventions exhibit strong position bias, as measured by the position where the thread appeared on the user interface at the time of intervention. We measure and remove this bias, enabling unbiased statistical modelling and evaluation. We show that our de-biased classifier improves predicting interventions over the state-of-the-art on courses with sufficient number of interventions by 8.2% in F1 and 24.4% in recall on average.</abstract>

        <abstract>Search engine is an important tool of modern academic study, but the results are lack of measurement of beginner friendliness. In order to improve the efficiency of using search engine for academic study, it is necessary to invent a technique of measuring the beginner friendliness of a Web page explaining academic concepts and to build an automatic measurement system. This paper studies how to integrate heterogeneous features such as a neural image feature generated from the image of the Web page by a variant of CNN (convolutional neural network) as well as text features extracted from the body text of the HTML file of the Web page. Integration is performed through the framework of the SVM classifier learning. Evaluation results show that heterogeneous features perform better than each individual type of features.</abstract>

        <abstract>Text clustering is a powerful technique to detect topics from document corpora, so as to provide information browsing, analysis, and organization. On the other hand, the Instant Response System (IRS) has been widely used in recent years to enhance student engagement in class and thus improve their learning effectiveness. However, the lack of functions to process short text responses from the IRS prevents the further application of IRS in classes. Therefore, this study aims to propose a proper short text clustering module for the IRS, and demonstrate our implemented techniques through real-world examples, so as to provide experiences and insights for further study. In particular, we have compared three clustering methods and the result shows that theoretically better methods need not lead to better results, as there are various factors that may affect the final performance.</abstract>

        <abstract>When learning Chinese as a foreign language, the learners may have some grammatical errors due to negative migration of their native languages. However, few grammar checking applications have been developed to support the learners. The goal of this paper is to develop a tool to automatically diagnose four types of grammatical errors which are redundant words (R), missing words (M), bad word selection (S) and disordered words (W) in Chinese sentences written by those foreign learners. In this paper, a conventional linear CRF model with specific feature engineering and a LSTM-CRF model are used to solve the CGED (Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis) task. We make some improvement on both models and the submitted results have better performance on false positive rate and accuracy than the average of all runs from CGED2018 for all three evaluation levels.</abstract>

        <abstract>Nowadays, more and more people are learning Chinese as their second language. Establishing an automatic diagnosis system for Chinese grammatical error has become an important challenge. In this paper, we propose a Chinese grammatical error diagnosis (CGED) model with contextualized character representation. Compared to the traditional model using LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory), our model have better performance and there is no need to add too many artificial features.</abstract>

        <abstract>Chinese grammatical error diagnosis is an important natural language processing (NLP) task, which is also an important application using artificial intelligence technology in language education. This paper introduces a system developed by the Chinese Multilingual and Multimodal Corpus and Big Data Research Center for the NLP-TEA shared task, named Chinese Grammar Error Diagnosis (CGED). This system regards diagnosing errors task as a sequence tagging problem, while takes correction task as a text classification problem. Finally, in the 12 teams, this system gets the highest F1 score in the detection task and the second highest F1 score in mean in the identification task, position task and the correction task.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the process of learning and using Chinese, many learners of Chinese as foreign language(CFL) may have grammar errors due to negative migration of their native languages. This paper introduces our system that can simultaneously diagnose four types of grammatical errors including redundant (R), missing (M), selection (S), disorder (W) in NLPTEA-5 shared task. We proposed a Bidirectional LSTM CRF neural network (BiLSTM-CRF) that combines BiLSTM and CRF without hand-craft features for Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis (CGED). Evaluation includes three levels, which are detection level, identification level and position level. At the detection level and identification level, our system got the third recall scores, and achieved good F1 values.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper presents a method of combining Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model with a post-processing layer using Google n-grams statistical information tailored to detect word selection and word order errors made by learners of Chinese as Foreign Language (CFL). We describe the architecture of the model and its performance in the shared task of the ACL 2018 Workshop on Natural Language Processing Techniques for Educational Applications (NLPTEA). This hybrid approach yields comparably high false positive rate (FPR = 0.1274) and precision (Pd= 0.7519; Pi= 0.6311), but low recall (Rd = 0.3035; Ri = 0.1696 ) in grammatical error detection and identification tasks. Additional statistical information and linguistic rules can be added to enhance the model performance in the future.</abstract>

        <abstract>This paper reports how we build a Chinese Grammatical Error Diagnosis system in the NLPTEA-2018 CGED shared task. In 2018, we sent three runs with three different approaches. The first one is a pattern-based approach by frequent error pattern matching. The second one is a sequential labelling approach by conditional random fields (CRF). The third one is a rewriting approach by sequence to sequence (seq2seq) model. The three approaches have different properties that aim to optimize different performance metrics and the formal run results show the differences as we expected.</abstract>

        <abstract>The main goal of Chinese grammatical error diagnosis task is to detect word er-rors in the sentences written by Chinese-learning students. Our previous system would generate error-corrected sentences as candidates and their sentence likeli-hood were measured based on a large scale Chinese n-gram dataset. This year we further tried to identify long frequent-ly-seen subsentences and label them as correct in order to avoid propose too many error candidates. Two new methods for suggesting missing and selection er-rors were also tested.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a neural net approach to determine Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) using attention-based bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM). To this date, most of the traditional STS systems were rule-based that built on top of excessive use of linguistic features and resources. In this paper, we present an end-to-end attention-based Bi-LSTM neural network system that solely takes word-level features, without expensive feature engineering work or the usage of external resources. By comparing its performance with traditional rule-based systems against SemEval-2012 benchmark, we make an assessment on the limitations and strengths of neural net systems to rule-based systems on Semantic Textual Similarity.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper shows how a Lexicon-Grammar dictionary of English phrasal verbs (PV) can be transformed into an electronic dictionary, and with the help of multiple grammars, dictionaries, and filters within the linguistic development environment, NooJ, how to accurately identify PV in large corpora. The NooJ program is an alternative to statistical methods commonly used in NLP: all PV are listed in a dictionary and then located by means of a PV grammar in both continuous and discontinuous format. Results are then refined with a series of dictionaries, disambiguating grammars, and other linguistics recourses. The main advantage of such a program is that all PV can be identified in any corpus. The only drawback is that PV not listed in the dictionary (e.g., archaic forms, recent neologisms) are not identified; however, new PV can easily be added to the electronic dictionary, which is freely available to all.</abstract>

    <abstract>The paper focusses on derivationally connected verbs in Croatian, i.e. on verbs that share the same lexical morpheme and are derived from other verbs via prefixation, suffixation and/or stem alternations. As in other Slavic languages with rich derivational morphology, each verb is marked for aspect, either perfective or imperfective. Some verbs, mostly of foreign origin, are marked as bi-aspectual verbs. The main objective of this paper is to detect and to describe major derivational processes and affixes used in the derivation of aspectually connected verbs with NooJ. Annotated chains are exported into a format adequate for web database system and further used to enhance the aspectual and derivational information for each verb.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a rule-based system for disambiguating frensh locative verbs and their translation to Arabic language. The disambiguation phase is based on the use of the French Verb dictionary (LVF) of Dubois and Dubois Charlier as a linguistic resource, from which a base of disambiguation rules is extracted. The extracted rules thus take the form of transducers which will be subsequently applied to texts. The translation phase consists in translating the disambiguated locative verbs returned by the disambiguation phase. The translation takes into account the verb’s tense used as well as the inflected form of the verb. This phase is based on bilingual dictionaries that contain the different French locative verbs and their translation into the Arabic language. The experimentation and the evaluation are done in the linguistic platform NooJ. The obtained results are satisfactory.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, a pedagogical application of NooJ to the teaching and learning of Spanish as a foreign language is presented, which is directed to a specific addressee: learners whose mother tongue is Italian. The category ‘adjective’ has been chosen on account of its lower frequency of occurrence in texts written in Spanish, and particularly in the Argentine Rioplatense variety, and with the aim of developing strategies to increase its use. In addition, the features that the adjective shares with other grammatical categories render it extremely productive and provide elements that enrich the learners’ proficiency. The reference corpus contains the front pages of the Argentinian newspaper Clar&#237;n related to an emblematic historical moment, whose starting point is 24 March 1976, when a military coup began, and covers a thirty year period until 24 March 2006. It can be seen how the term desaparecido emerges with all its cultural and social charge, providing a context which allows an approach to Rioplatense Spanish from a more comprehensive perspective. Finally, a pedagogical proposal accounting for the application of the NooJ platform in language teaching is included.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe a resource derived through extraction of a set of argument realizations from an existing lexical-conceptual structure (LCS) Verb Database of 500 verb classes (containing a total of 9525 verb entries) to include information about realization of arguments for a range of different verb classes. We demonstrate that our extended resource, called STYLUS (SysTematicallY Derived Language USe), enables systematic derivation of regular patterns of language usage without requiring manual annotation. We posit that both spatially oriented applications such as robot navigation and more general applications such as narrative generation require a layered representation scheme where a set of primitives (often grounded in space/motion such as GO) is coupled with a representation of constraints at the syntax-semantics interface. We demonstrate that the resulting resource covers three cases of lexico-semantic operations applicable to both language understanding and language generation.</abstract>

    <abstract>We introduced the contemporary Amharic corpus, which is automatically tagged for morpho-syntactic information. Texts are collected from 25,199 documents from different domains and about 24 million orthographic words are tokenized. Since it is partly a web corpus, we made some automatic spelling error correction. We have also modified the existing morphological analyzer, HornMorpho, to use it for the automatic tagging.</abstract>

    <abstract>Most extractive summarization techniques operate by ranking all the source sentences and then select the top ranked sentences as the summary. Such methods are known to produce good summaries, especially when applied to news articles and scientific texts. However, they don't fare so well when applied to texts such as fictional narratives, which don't have a single central or recurrent theme. This is because usually the information or plot of the story is spread across several sentences. In this paper, we discuss a different summarization technique called Telegraphic Summarization. Here, we don't select whole sentences, rather pick short segments of text spread across sentences, as the summary. We have tailored a set of guidelines to create such summaries and, using the same, annotate a gold corpus of 200 English short stories.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we describe the first Tigrinya Languages speech corpora designed and development for speech recognition purposes. Tigrinya, often written as Tigrigna (ትግርኛ) /tɪˈɡrinjə/ belongs to the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages where it shows the characteristic features of a Semitic language. It is spoken by ethnic Tigray-Tigrigna people in the Horn of Africa. The paper outlines different corpus designing process analysis of related work on speech corpora creation for different languages. The authors provide also procedures that were used for the creation of Tigrinya speech recognition corpus which is the under-resourced language. One hundred and thirty speakers, native to Tigrinya language, were recorded for training and test dataset set. Each speaker read 100 texts, which consisted of syllabically rich and balanced sentences. Ten thousand sets of sentences were used to prompt sheets. These sentences contained all of the contextual syllables and phones.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian Languages: Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Geez. To check the usability of all the corpora we conducted baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation (SMT) experiments for seven language pairs. The performance of the bi-directional SMT systems shows that all the corpora can be used for further investigations. We have also shown that the morphological complexity of the Ethio-Semitic languages has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially when they are target languages. Based on the results we obtained, we are currently working towards handling the morphological complexities to improve the performance of statistical machine translation among the Ethiopian languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>Much interest in Frame Semantics is fueled by the substantial extent of its applicability across languages. At the same time, lexicographic studies have found that the applicability of individual frames can be diminished by cross-lingual divergences regarding polysemy, syntactic valency, and lexicalization. Due to the large effort involved in manual investigations, there are so far no broad-coverage resources with "problematic" frames for any language pair. Our study investigates to what extent multilingual vector representations of frames learned from manually annotated corpora can address this need by serving as a wide coverage source for such divergences. We present a case study for the language pair English — German using the FrameNet and SALSA corpora and find that inferences can be made about cross-lingual frame applicability using a vector space model.</abstract>

    <abstract>Translation relations, which distinguish literal translation from other translation techniques, constitute an important subject of study for human translators (Chuquet and Paillard, 1989). However, automatic processing techniques based on interlingual relations, such as machine translation or paraphrase generation exploiting translational equivalence, have not exploited these relations explicitly until now. In this work, we present a categorisation of translation relations and annotate them in a parallel multilingual (English, French, Chinese) corpus of oral presentations, the TED Talks. Our long term objective will be to automatically detect these relations in order to integrate them as important characteristics for the search of monolingual segments in relation of equivalence (paraphrases) or of entailment. The annotated corpus resulting from our work will be made available to the community.</abstract>

    <abstract>We work on improving the Cesselin, a large and open source Japanese-French bilingual dictionary digitalized by OCR, available on the web, and contributively improvable online. Labelling its examples (about 226000) would significantly enhance their usefulness for language learners. Examples are proverbs, idiomatic constructions, normal usage examples, and, for nouns, phrases containing a quantifier. Proverbs are easy to spot, but not examples of other types. To find a method for automatically or at least semi-automatically annotating them, we have studied many entries, and hypothesized that the degree of lexical similarity between results of MT into a third language might give good cues. To confirm that hypothesis, we sampled 500 examples and used Google Translate to translate into English their Japanese expressions and their French translations. The hypothesis holds well, in particular for distinguishing examples of normal usage from idiomatic examples. Finally, we propose a detailed annotation procedure and discuss its future automatization.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper performs a detailed analysis on the alignment of Portuguese contractions, based on a previously aligned bilingual corpus. The alignment task was performed manually in a subset of the English-Portuguese CLUE4Translation Alignment Collection. The initial parallel corpus was pre-processed and, a decision was made as to whether the contraction should be maintained or decomposed in the alignment. Decomposition was required in the cases in which the two words that have been concatenated, i.e., the preposition and the determiner or pronoun, go in two separate translation alignment pairs (e.g., [no seio de] [a União Europeia] | [within] [the European Union]). Most contractions required decomposition in contexts where they are positioned at the end of a multiword unit. On the other hand, contractions tend to be maintained when they occur in the beginning or in the middle of the multiword unit, i.e., in the frozen part of the multiword (e.g., [no que diz respeito a] | [with regard to] or [al&#233;m disso] [in addition]. A correct alignment of multiwords and phrasal units containing contractions is instrumental for machine translation, paraphrasing, and variety adaptation.</abstract>

    <abstract>Code-mixing, use of two or more languages in a single sentence, is ubiquitous; generated by multi-lingual speakers across the world. The phenomenon presents itself prominently in social media discourse. Consequently, there is a growing need for translating code-mixed hybrid lan- guage into standard languages. However, due to the lack of gold parallel data, existing machine translation systems fail to properly translate code-mixed text. In an effort to initiate the task of machine translation of code-mixed content, we present a newly created parallel corpus of code-mixed English-Hindi and English. We selected previously avail- able English-Hindi code-mixed data as a starting point for the creation of our parallel corpus. We then chose 4 human translators, fluent in both English and Hindi, for translating the 6088 code-mixed English-Hindi sentences to English. With the help of the created parallel corpus, we analyzed the structure of English-Hindi code- mixed data and present a technique to augment run-of-the-mill machine translation (MT) ap- proaches that can help achieve superior translations without the need for specially designed trans- lation systems. We present an augmentation pipeline for existing MT approaches, like Phrase Based MT (Moses) and Neural MT, to improve the translation of code-mixed text. The augmen- tation pipeline is presented as a pre-processing step and can be plugged with any existing MT system, which we demonstrate by improving translations done by systems like Moses, Google Neural Machine Translation System (NMTS) and Bing Translator for English-Hindi code-mixed content.</abstract>

The campaign was organized as part of the fifth edition of the VarDial workshop, collocated with COLING’2018. This year, the campaign included five shared tasks, including two task re-runs &#8211; Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) and German Dialect Identification (GDI) &#8211;, and three new tasks &#8211; Morphosyntactic Tagging of Tweets (MTT), Discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles (DFS), and Indo-Aryan Language Identification (ILI). A total of 24 teams submitted runs across the five shared tasks, and contributed 22 system description papers, which were included in the VarDial workshop proceedings and are referred to in this report.</abstract>

    <abstract>Text normalization is the task of mapping non-canonical language, typical of speech transcription and computer-mediated communication, to a standardized writing. It is an up-stream task necessary to enable the subsequent direct employment of standard natural language processing tools and indispensable for languages such as Swiss German, with strong regional variation and no written standard. Text normalization has been addressed with a variety of methods, most successfully with character-level statistical machine translation (CSMT). In the meantime, machine translation has changed and the new methods, known as neural encoder-decoder (ED) models, resulted in remarkable improvements. Text normalization, however, has not yet followed. A number of neural methods have been tried, but CSMT remains the state-of-the-art. In this work, we normalize Swiss German WhatsApp messages using the ED framework. We exploit the flexibility of this framework, which allows us to learn from the same training data in different ways. In particular, we modify the decoding stage of a plain ED model to include target-side language models operating at different levels of granularity: characters and words. Our systematic comparison shows that our approach results in an improvement over the CSMT state-of-the-art.</abstract>

    <abstract>False friends are words in two languages that look or sound similar, but have different meanings. They are a common source of confusion among language learners. Methods to detect them automatically do exist, however they make use of large aligned bilingual corpora, which are hard to find and expensive to build, or encounter problems dealing with infrequent words. In this work we propose a high coverage method that uses word vector representations to build a false friends classifier for any pair of languages, which we apply to the particular case of Spanish and Portuguese. The required resources are a large corpus for each language and a small bilingual lexicon for the pair.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents the submission of the UH and CU team (Joint University of Colorado and University of Helsinki team) for the VarDial 2018 shared task on morphosyntactic tagging of Croatian, Slovenian and Serbian tweets. Our system is a bidirectional LSTM tagger which emits tags as character sequences using an LSTM generator in order to be able to handle unknown tags and combinations of several tags for one token which occur in the shared task data sets. To the best of our knowledge, using an LSTM generator is a novel approach. The system delivers sizable improvements of more than 6\%-points over a baseline trigram tagger. Overall, the performance of our system is quite even for all three languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>Luyia is a macrolanguage in central Kenya. The Luyia languages, like other Bantu languages, have a complex morphological system. This system can be leveraged to aid in part of speech tagging. Bag-of-characters taggers trained on a source Luyia language can be applied directly to another Luyia language with some degree of success. In addition, mixing data from the target language with data from the source language does produce more accurate predictive models compared to models trained on just the target language data when the training set size is small. However, for both of these tagging tasks, models involving the more distantly related language, Tiriki, are better at predicting part of speech tags for Wanga data. The models incorporating Bukusu data are not as successful despite the closer relationship between Bukusu and Wanga. Overlapping vocabulary between the Wanga and Tiriki corpora as well as a bias towards open class words help Tiriki outperform Bukusu.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes our systems for the VarDial 2018 evaluation campaign. We participated in all language identification tasks, namely, Arabic dialect identification (ADI), German dialect identification (GDI), discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles (DFS), and Indo-Aryan Language Identification (ILI). In all of the tasks, we only used textual transcripts (not using audio features for ADI). We submitted system runs based on support vector machine classifiers (SVMs) with bag of character and word n-grams as features, and gated bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using units of characters and words. Our SVM models outperformed our RNN models in all tasks, obtaining the first place on the DFS task, third place on the ADI task, and second place on others according to the official rankings. As well as describing the models we used in the shared task participation, we present an analysis of the n-gram features used by the SVM models in each task, and also report additional results (that were run after the official competition deadline) on the GDI surprise dialect track.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a machine learning approach that ranked on the first place in the Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) Closed Shared Tasks of the 2018 VarDial Evaluation Campaign. The proposed approach combines several kernels using multiple kernel learning. While most of our kernels are based on character p-grams (also known as n-grams) extracted from speech or phonetic transcripts, we also use a kernel based on dialectal embeddings generated from audio recordings by the organizers. In the learning stage, we independently employ Kernel Discriminant Analysis (KDA) and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). Preliminary experiments indicate that KRR provides better classification results. Our approach is shallow and simple, but the empirical results obtained in the 2018 ADI Closed Shared Task prove that it achieves the best performance. Furthermore, our top macro-F1 score (58.92%) is significantly better than the second best score (57.59%) in the 2018 ADI Shared Task, according to the statistical significance test performed by the organizers. Nevertheless, we obtain even better post-competition results (a macro-F1 score of 62.28%) using the audio embeddings released by the organizers after the competition. With a very similar approach (that did not include phonetic features), we also ranked first in the ADI Closed Shared Tasks of the 2017 VarDial Evaluation Campaign, surpassing the second best method by 4.62%. We therefore conclude that our multiple kernel learning method is the best approach to date for Arabic dialect identification.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatic image description systems are commonly trained and evaluated on written image descriptions. At the same time, these systems are often used to provide spoken descriptions (e.g. for visually impaired users) through apps like TapTapSee or Seeing AI. This is not a problem, as long as spoken and written descriptions are very similar. However, linguistic research suggests that spoken language often differs from written language. These differences are not regular, and vary from context to context. Therefore, this paper investigates whether there are differences between written and spoken image descriptions, even if they are elicited through similar tasks. We compare descriptions produced in two languages (English and Dutch), and in both languages observe substantial differences between spoken and written descriptions. Future research should see if users prefer the spoken over the written style and, if so, aim to emulate spoken descriptions.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatic speech recognition and spoken dialogue systems have made great advances through the use of deep machine learning methods. This is partly due to greater computing power but also through the large amount of data available in common languages, such as English. Conversely, research in minority languages, including sign languages, is hampered by the severe lack of data. This has led to work on transfer learning methods, whereby a model developed for one language is reused as the starting point for a model on a second language, which is less resourced. In this paper, we examine two transfer learning techniques of fine-tuning and layer substitution for language modelling of British Sign Language. Our results show improvement in perplexity when using transfer learning with standard stacked LSTM models, trained initially using a large corpus for standard English from the Penn Treebank corpus.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a methodology to extract a paraphrase database for the European and Brazilian varieties of Portuguese, and discusses a set of paraphrastic categories of multiwords and phrasal units, such as the compounds "toda a gente" versus "todo o mundo" 'everybody’ or the gerundive constructions [estar a + V-Inf] versus [ficar + V-Ger] (e.g., "estive a observar" | "fiquei observando" 'I was observing’), which are extremely relevant to high quality paraphrasing. The variants were manually aligned in the e-PACT corpus, using the CLUE-Aligner tool. The methodology, inspired in the Logos Model, focuses on a semantico-syntactic analysis of each paraphrastic unit and constitutes a subset of the Gold-CLUE-Paraphrases. The construction of a larger dataset of paraphrastic contrasts among the distinct varieties of the Portuguese language is indispensable for variety adaptation, i.e., for dealing with the cultural, linguistic and stylistic differences between them, making it possible to convert texts (semi-)automatically from one variety into another, a key function in paraphrasing systems. This topic represents an interesting new line of research with valuable applications in language learning, language generation, question-answering, summarization, and machine translation, among others. The paraphrastic units are the first resource of its kind for Portuguese to become available to the scientific community for research purposes.</abstract>

We participate by training several Neural Network models showing that we can obtain competitive results despite the limited amount of training data available for learning. We report our experiments and detail the network architecture and parameters of our 3 runs: our best performing system consists in a Multi-Input CNN that learns separate embeddings for lexical, phonetic and acoustic input features (F1: 0.5289); we also built a CNN-biLSTM network aimed at capturing both spatial and sequential features directly from speech spectrograms (F1: 0.3894 at submission time, F1: 0.4235 with later found parameters); and finally a system relying on binary CNN-biLSTMs (F1: 0.4339).</abstract>

    <abstract>The objective of this work is to quantify, with a simple and robust measure, the distance between historical varieties of a language. The measure will be inferred from text corpora corresponding to historical periods. Different approaches have been proposed for similar aims: Language Identification, Phylogenetics, Historical Linguistics or Dialectology. In our approach, we used a perplexity-based measure to calculate language distance between all the historical periods of a specific language: European Portuguese. Perplexity has also proven to be a robust metric to calculate distance between languages. However, this measure has not been tested yet to identify diachronic periods within the historical evolution of a specific language. For this purpose, a historical Portuguese corpus has been constructed from different open sources containing texts with close original spelling. The results of our experiments show that Portuguese keeps an important degree of homogeneity over time. We anticipate this metric to be a starting point to be applied to other languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents two systems taking part in the Morphosyntactic Tagging of Tweets shared task on Slovene, Croatian and Serbian data, organized inside the VarDial Evaluation Campaign. While one system relies on the traditional method for sequence labeling (conditional random fields), the other relies on its neural alternative (bidirectional long short-term memory). We investigate the similarities and differences of these two approaches, showing that both methods yield very good and quite similar results, with the neural model outperforming the traditional one more as the level of non-standardness of the text increases. Through an error analysis we show that the neural system is better at long-range dependencies, while the traditional system excels and slightly outperforms the neural system at the local ones. We present in the paper new state-of-the-art results in morphosyntactic annotation of non-standard text for Slovene, Croatian and Serbian.</abstract>

    <abstract>The present contribution revolves around efficient approaches to language classification which have been field-tested in the Vardial evaluation campaign. The methods used in several language identification tasks comprising different language types are presented and their results are discussed, giving insights on real-world application of regularization, linear classifiers and corresponding linguistic features. The use of a specially adapted Ridge classifier proved useful in 2 tasks out of 3. The overall approach (XAC) has slightly outperformed most of the other systems on the DFS task (Dutch and Flemish) and on the ILI task (Indo-Aryan languages), while its comparative performance was poorer in on the GDI task (Swiss German dialects).</abstract>

    <abstract>Text language Identification is a Natural Language Processing task of identifying and recognizing a given language out of many different languages from a piece of text. This paper describes our submission to the ILI 2018 shared-task, which includes the identification of 5 closely related Indo-Aryan languages. We developed a word-level LSTM(Long Short-term Memory) model, a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network model, for this task. Given a sentence, our model embeds each word of the sentence and convert into its trainable word embedding, feeds them into our LSTM network and finally predict the language. We obtained an F1 macro score of 0.836, ranking 5th in the task.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes CLiPS's submissions for the Discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles (DFS) shared task at VarDial 2018. We explore different ways to combine classifiers trained on different feature groups. Our best system uses two Linear SVM classifiers; one trained on lexical features (word n-grams) and one trained on syntactic features (PoS n-grams). The final prediction for a document to be in Flemish Dutch or Netherlandic Dutch is made by the classifier that outputs the highest probability for one of the two labels. This confidence vote approach outperforms a meta-classifier on the development data and on the test data.</abstract>

    <abstract>With the goal of discovering differences between Belgian and Netherlandic Dutch, we participated as Team Taurus in the Dutch-Flemish Subtitles task of VarDial2018. We used a rather simple marker-based method, but a wide range of features, including lexical, lexico-syntactic and syntactic ones, and achieved a second position in the ranking. Inspection of highly distin-guishing features did point towards differences between the two language varieties, but because of the nature of the experimental data, we have to treat our observations as very tentative and in need of further investigation.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes our Automatic Dialect Recognition (ADI) system for the VarDial 2018 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing four major Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). The training and development ADI VarDial 2018 data consists of 16,157 utterances, their words transcription, their phonetic transcriptions obtained with four non-Arabic phoneme recognizers and acoustic embedding data. Our overall system is a combination of four different systems. One system uses the words transcriptions and tries to recognize the speaker dialect by modeling the sequence of words for each dialect. Another system tries to recognize the dialect by modeling the phones sequence produced by non-Arabic phone recognizers, whereas, the other two systems use GMM trained on the acoustic features for recognizing the dialect. The best performance was achieved by the fused system which combines four systems together, with F1 micro of 68.77%.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe our approaches used in the German Dialect Identification (GDI) task at the VarDial Evaluation Campaign 2018. The goal was to identify to which out of four dialects spoken in German speaking part of Switzerland a sentence belonged to. We adopted two different meta classifier approaches and used some data mining insights to improve the preprocessing and the meta classifier parameters. Especially, we focused on using different feature extraction methods and how to combine them, since they influenced very differently the performance of the system. Our system achieved second place out of 8 teams, with a macro averaged F-1 of 64.6%.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we describe a morpho-syntactic tagger of tweets, an important component of the CEA List DeepLIMA tool which is a multilingual text analysis platform based on deep learning. This tagger is built for the Morpho-syntactic Tagging of Tweets (MTT) Shared task of the 2018 VarDial Evaluation Campaign. The MTT task focuses on morpho-syntactic annotation of non-canonical Twitter varieties of three South-Slavic languages: Slovene, Croatian and Serbian. We propose to use a neural network model trained in an end-to-end manner for the three languages without any need for task or domain specific features engineering. The proposed approach combines both character and word level representations. Considering the lack of annotated data in the social media domain for South-Slavic languages, we have also implemented a cross-domain Transfer Learning (TL) approach to exploit any available related out-of-domain annotated data.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we present the results of our participation in the Discriminating between Dutch and Flemish in Subtitles VarDial 2018 shared task. We try techniques proven to work well for discriminating between language varieties as well as explore the potential of using syntactic features, i.e. hierarchical syntactic subtrees. We experiment with different combinations of features. Discriminating between these two languages turned out to be a very hard task, not only for a machine: human performance is only around 0.51 F1 score; our best system is still a simple Naive Bayes model with word unigrams and bigrams. The system achieved an F1 score (macro) of 0.62, which ranked us 4th in the shared task.</abstract>

Our submission using HeLI with adaptive language models obtained the best results in the shared task with a macro F1-score of 0.686, which is clearly higher than the other submitted results. Without some form of unsupervised adaptation on the test set, it might not be possible to reach as high an F1-score with the level of domain difference between the datasets of the shared task.

    <abstract>The Arabic Online Commentary (AOC) (Zaidan and Callison-Burch, 2011) is a large-scale repos-itory of Arabic dialects with manual labels for4varieties of the language. Existing dialect iden-tification models exploiting the dataset pre-date the recent boost deep learning brought to NLPand hence the data are not benchmarked for use with deep learning, nor is it clear how much neural networks can help tease the categories in the data apart. We treat these two limitations:We (1) benchmark the data, and (2) empirically test6different deep learning methods on thetask, comparing peformance to several classical machine learning models under different condi-tions (i.e., both binary and multi-way classification). Our experimental results show that variantsof (attention-based) bidirectional recurrent neural networks achieve best accuracy (acc) on thetask, significantly outperforming all competitive baselines. On blind test data, our models reach87.65%acc on the binary task (MSA vs. dialects),87.4%acc on the 3-way dialect task (Egyptianvs. Gulf vs. Levantine), and82.45%acc on the 4-way variants task (MSA vs. Egyptian vs. Gulfvs. Levantine). We release our benchmark for future work on the dataset</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we present the first neural-based machine translation system trained to translate between standard national varieties of the same language. We take the pair Brazilian - European Portuguese as an example and compare the performance of this method to a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. We report a performance improvement of 0.9 BLEU points in translating from European to Brazilian Portuguese and 0.2 BLEU points when translating in the opposite direction. We also carried out a human evaluation experiment with native speakers of Brazilian Portuguese which indicates that humans prefer the output produced by the neural-based system in comparison to the statistical system.</abstract>

    <abstract>The goal of our industrial ticketing system is to retrieve a relevant solution for an input query, by matching with historical tickets stored in knowledge base. A query is comprised of subject and description, while a historical ticket consists of subject, description and solution. To retrieve a relevant solution, we use textual similarity paradigm to learn similarity in the query and historical tickets. The task is challenging due to significant term mismatch in the query and ticket pairs of asymmetric lengths, where subject is a short text but description and solution are multi-sentence texts. We present a novel Replicated Siamese LSTM model to learn similarity in asymmetric text pairs, that gives 22% and 7% gain (Accuracy$@$10) for retrieval task, respectively over unsupervised and supervised baselines. We also show that the topic and distributed semantic features for short and long texts improved both similarity learning and retrieval.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this study, we develop content features for an automated scoring system of non-native English speakers' spontaneous speech. The features calculate the lexical similarity between the question text and the ASR word hypothesis of the spoken response, based on traditional word vector models or word embeddings. The proposed features do not require any sample training responses for each question, and this is a strong advantage since collecting question-specific data is an expensive task, and sometimes even impossible due to concerns about question exposure. We explore the impact of these new features on the automated scoring of two different question types: (a) providing opinions on familiar topics and (b) answering a question about a stimulus material. The proposed features showed statistically significant correlations with the oral proficiency scores, and the combination of new features with the speech-driven features achieved a small but significant further improvement for the latter question type. Further analyses suggested that the new features were effective in assigning more accurate scores for responses with serious content issues.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatically learnt word sense embeddings are developed as an attempt to refine the capabilities of coarse word embeddings. The word sense representations obtained this way are, however, sensitive to underlying corpora and parameterizations, and they might be difficult to relate to formally defined word senses. We propose to tackle this problem by devising a mechanism to establish links between word sense embeddings and lexical resources created by experts. We evaluate the applicability of these links in a task to retrieve instances of word sense unlisted in the lexicon.</abstract>

    <abstract>Existing NLP models are mostly trained with data from well-resourced languages. Most minority languages face the challenge of lack of resources - data and technologies - for NLP research. Building these resources from scratch for each minority language will be very expensive, time-consuming and amount largely to unnecessarily re-inventing the wheel. In this paper, we applied transfer learning techniques to create Igbo word embeddings from a variety of existing English trained embeddings. Transfer learning methods were also used to build standard datasets for Igbo word similarity and analogy tasks for intrinsic evaluation of embeddings. These projected embeddings were also applied to diacritic restoration task. Our results indicate that the projected models not only outperform the trained ones on the semantic-based tasks of analogy, word-similarity, and odd-word identifying, but they also achieve enhanced performance on the diacritic restoration with learned diacritic embeddings.</abstract>

Our tool is named as 'పారుపల్లి పదజాలం' (Parupalli Padajaalam) which means web of words by Parupalli. The aim of this tool is to populate the OntoSenseNet, sentiment polarity annotated Telugu resource. Recent works have shown the importance of word-level annotations on sentiment analysis. With this as basis, we aim to analyze the importance of sense-annotations obtained from OntoSenseNet in performing the task of sentiment analysis. We explain the features extracted from OntoSenseNet (Telugu). Furthermore we compute and explain the adverbial class distribution of verbs in OntoSenseNet. This task is known to aid in disambiguating word-senses which helps in enhancing the performance of word-sense disambiguation (WSD) task(s).</abstract>

    <abstract>Entity embeddings are vector space representations of a given domain of interest. They are typically
learned from text corpora (possibly in combination with any available structured knowledge), based on
the intuition that similar entities should be represented by similar vectors. The usefulness of such entity
embeddings largely stems from the fact that they implicitly encode a rich amount of knowledge about the
considered domain, beyond mere similarity. In an embedding of movies, for instance, we may expect all
movies from a given genre to be located in some low-dimensional manifold. This is particularly useful
in supervised learning settings, where it may e.g. allow neural movie recommenders to base predictions
on the genre of a movie, without that genre having to be specified explicitly for each movie, or without
even the need to specify that the genre of a movie is a property that may have predictive value for
the considered task. In unsupervised settings, however, such implicitly encoded knowledge cannot be
leveraged.
Conceptual spaces, as proposed by Grdenfors, are similar to entity embeddings, but provide more
structure. In conceptual spaces, among others, dimensions are interpretable and grouped into facets, and
properties and concepts are explicitly modelled as (vague) regions. Thanks to this additional structure,
conceptual spaces can be used as a knowledge representation framework, which can also be effectively
exploited in unsupervised settings. Given a conceptual space of movies, for instance, we are able to answer
queries that ask about similarity w.r.t. a particular facet (e.g. movies which are cinematographically
similar to Jurassic Park), that refer to a given feature (e.g. movies which are scarier than Jurassic Park
but otherwise similar), or that refer to particular properties or concepts (e.g. thriller from the 1990s with
a dinosaur theme). Compared to standard entity embeddings, however, conceptual spaces are more challenging
to learn in a purely data-driven fashion. In this talk, I will give an overview of some approaches
for learning such representations that have recently been developed within the context of the FLEXILOG
project.</abstract>

    <abstract>These days, most general knowledge question-answering systems rely on large-scale knowledge bases
comprising billions of facts about millions of entities. Having a structured source of semantic knowledge
means that we can answer questions involving single static facts (e.g. “Who was the 8th president of the
US?”) or dynamically generated ones (e.g. “How old is Donald Trump?”). More importantly, we can
answer questions involving multiple inference steps (“Is the queen older than the president of the US?”).
In this talk, I’m going to be discussing some of the unique challenges that are involved with building
and maintaining a consistent knowledge base for Alexa, extending it with new facts and using it to serve
answers in multiple languages. I will focus on three recent projects from our group. First, a way of
measuring the completeness of a knowledge base, that is based on usage patterns. The definition of the
usage of the KB is done in terms of the relation distribution of entities seen in question-answer logs.
Instead of directly estimating the relation distribution of individual entities, it is generalized to the “class
signature” of each entity. For example, users ask for baseball players’ height, age, and batting average,
so a knowledge base is complete (with respect to baseball players) if every entity has facts for those three
relations.
Second, an investigation into fact extraction from unstructured text. I will present a method for creating
distant (weak) supervision labels for training a large-scale relation extraction system. I will also discuss
the effectiveness of neural network approaches by decoupling the model architecture from the feature
design of a state-of-the-art neural network system. Surprisingly, a much simpler classifier trained on
similar features performs on par with the highly complex neural network system (at 75x reduction to the
training time), suggesting that the features are a bigger contributor to the final performance.
Finally, I will present the Fact Extraction and VERification (FEVER) dataset and challenge. The
dataset comprises more than 185,000 human-generated claims extracted from Wikipedia pages. False
claims were generated by mutating true claims in a variety of ways, some of which were meaningaltering.
During the verification step, annotators were required to label a claim for its validity and also
supply full-sentence textual evidence from (potentially multiple) Wikipedia articles for the label. With
FEVER, we aim to help create a new generation of transparent and interprable knowledge extraction
systems.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose a compositional Bayesian semantics that interprets declarative sentences in a natural language by assigning them probability conditions. These are conditional probabilities that estimate the likelihood that a competent speaker would endorse an assertion, given certain hypotheses. Our semantics is implemented in a functional programming language. It estimates the marginal probability of a sentence through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of objects in vector space models satisfying specified hypotheses. We apply our semantics to examples with several predicates and generalised quantifiers, including higher-order quantifiers. It captures the vagueness of predication (both gradable and non-gradable), without positing a precise boundary for classifier application. We present a basic account of semantic learning based on our semantic system. We compare our proposal to other current theories of probabilistic semantics, and we show that it offers several important advantages over these accounts.</abstract>

    <abstract>Natural language processing researchers have proven the ability of machine learning approaches to detect depression-related cues from language; however, to date, these efforts have primarily assumed it was acceptable to leave depression-related texts in the data. Our concerns with this are twofold: first, that the models may be overfitting on depression-related signals, which may not be present in all depressed users (only those who talk about depression on social media); and second, that these models would under-perform for users who are sensitive to the public stigma of depression. This study demonstrates the validity to those concerns. We construct a novel corpus of texts from 12,106 Reddit users and perform lexical and predictive analyses under two conditions: one where all text produced by the users is included and one where the depression data is withheld. We find significant differences in the language used by depressed users under the two conditions as well as a difference in the ability of machine learning algorithms to correctly detect depression. However, despite the lexical differences and reduced classification performance&#8211;each of which suggests that users may be able to fool algorithms by avoiding direct discussion of depression&#8211;a still respectable overall performance suggests lexical models are reasonably robust and well suited for a role in a diagnostic or monitoring capacity.</abstract>

    <abstract>Arabic Broken Plurals show an interesting phenomenon in Arabic morphology as they are formed by shifting the consonants of the syllables into different syllable patterns, and subsequently, the pattern of the word changes. The present paper, therefore, attempts to look at Arabic broken plurals from the perspective of neural networks by implementing an OpenNMT experiment to better understand and interpret the behavior of these plurals, especially when it comes to L2 acquisition. The results show that the model is successful in predicting the Arabic template. However, it fails to predict certain consonants such as the emphatics and the gutturals. This reinforces the fact that these consonants or sounds are the most difficult for L2 learners to acquire.</abstract>

    <abstract>Ever increasing ransomware attacks and thefts of intellectual property demand cybersecurity solutions to protect critical documents. One emerging solution is to place fake text documents in the repository of critical documents for deceiving and catching cyber attackers. We can generate fake text documents by obscuring the salient information in legit text documents. However, the obscuring process can result in linguistic inconsistencies, such as broken co-references and illogical flow of ideas across the sentences, which can discern the fake document and render it unbelievable. In this paper, we propose a novel method to generate believable fake text documents by automatically improving the linguistic consistency of computer-generated fake text. Our method focuses on enhancing syntactic cohesion and semantic coherence across discourse segments. We conduct experiments with human subjects to evaluate the effect of believability improvements in distinguishing legit texts from fake texts. Results show that the probability to distinguish legit texts from believable fake texts is consistently lower than from fake texts that have not been improved in believability. This indicates the effectiveness of our method in generating believable fake text.</abstract>

    <abstract>The Winograd Schema Challenge targets pronominal anaphora resolution problems which require the application of cognitive inference in combination with world knowledge. These problems are easy to solve for humans but most difficult to solve for machines. Computational models that previously addressed this task rely on syntactic preprocessing and incorporation of external knowledge by manually crafted features. We address the Winograd Schema Challenge from a new perspective as a sequence ranking task, and design a Siamese neural sequence ranking model which performs significantly better than a random baseline, even when solely trained on sequences of words. We evaluate against a baseline and a state-of-the-art system on two data sets and show that anonymization of noun phrase candidates strongly helps our model to generalize.</abstract>

    <abstract>Sentences with presuppositions are often treated as uninterpretable or unvalued (neither true nor false) if their presuppositions are not satisfied. However, there is an open question as to how this satisfaction is calculated. In some cases, determining whether a presupposition is satisfied is not a trivial task (or even a decidable one), yet native speakers are able to quickly and confidently identify instances of presupposition failure. I propose that this can be accounted for with a form of possible world semantics that encapsulates some reasoning abilities, but is limited in its computational power, thus circumventing the need to solve computationally difficult problems. This can be modeled using a variant of the framework of finite state semantics proposed by Rooth (2017). A few modifications to this system are necessary, including its extension into a three-valued logic to account for presupposition. Within this framework, the logic necessary to calculate presupposition satisfaction is readily available, but there is no risk of needing exceptional computational power. This correctly predicts that certain presuppositions will not be calculated intuitively, while others can be easily evaluated.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper explores the correlations between key syntactic dependencies and the occurrence of simple spoken language disfluencies such as filled pauses and incomplete words. The working hypothesis here is that interruptions caused by these phenomena are more likely to happen between weakly connected words from a syntactic point of view than between strongly connected ones. The obtained results show significant patterns with the regard to key syntactic phenomena, like confirming the positive correlation between the frequency of disfluencies and multiples measures of syntactic complexity. In addition, they show that there is a stronger relationship between the verb and its subject than with its object, which confirms the idea of a hierarchical incrementality. Also, this work uncovered an interesting role played by a verb particle as a syntactic delimiter of some verb complements. Finally, the interruptions by disfluencies patterns show that verbs have a more privileged relationship with their preposition compared to the object Noun Phrase (NP).</abstract>

    <abstract>Older adults tend to suffer a decline in some of their cognitive capabilities, being language one of least affected processes. Word association norms (WAN) also known as free word associations reflect word-word relations, the participant reads or hears a word and is asked to write or say the first word that comes to mind. Free word associations show how the organization of semantic memory remains almost unchanged with age. We have performed a WAN task with very small samples of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and mixed dementia (MxD), and also with a control group of typical aging adults, matched by age, sex and education. All of them are native speakers of Mexican Spanish. The results show, as expected, that Alzheimer disease has a very important impact in lexical retrieval, unlike vascular and mixed dementia. This suggests that linguistic tests elaborated from WAN can be also used for detecting AD at early stages.</abstract>

We provide a comparison of 2 approaches to annotating code-mixed data &#8211; a) annotation of the texts from the two languages using monolingual resources from each language and b) annotation of the text through a different resource created specifically for code-mixed data. We present a comparative study of the efforts required in each approach and the final performance of the system. Based on this, we argue that it might be a better approach to develop new technologies using code-mixed data instead of monolingual, 'clean' data, especially for those languages where we do not have significant tools and technologies available till now.</abstract>

    <abstract>Censorship of Internet content in China is understood to operate through a system of intermediary liability whereby service providers are liable for the content on their platforms. Previous work studying censorship has found huge variability in the implementation of censorship across different products even within the same industry segment. In this work we explore the extent to which these censorship features are present in the open source projects of individual developers in China by collecting their blacklists and comparing their similarity. We collect files from a popular online code repository, extract lists of strings, and then classify whether each is a Chinese blacklist. Overall, we found over 1,000 Chinese blacklists comprising over 200,000 unique keywords, representing the largest dataset of Chinese blacklisted keywords to date. We found very little keyword overlap between lists, raising questions as to their origins, as the lists seem too large to have been individually curated, yet the lack of overlap suggests that they have no common source.</abstract>

    <abstract>People often create obfuscated language for online communication to avoid Internet censorship, share sensitive information, express strong sentiment or emotion, plan for secret actions, trade illegal products, or simply hold interesting conversations. In this position paper we systematically categorize human-created obfuscated language on various levels, investigate their basic mechanisms, give an overview on automated techniques needed to simulate human encoding. These encoders have potential to frustrate and evade, co‐evolve with dynamic human or automated decoders, and produce interesting and adoptable code words. We also summarize remaining challenges for future research on the interaction between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and encryption, and leveraging NLP techniques for encoding and decoding.</abstract>

    <abstract>Most work within the computational event modeling community has tended to focus on the interpretation and ordering of events that are associated with verbs and event nominals in linguistic expressions. What is often overlooked in the construction of a global interpretation of a narrative is the role contributed by the objects participating in these structures, and the latent events and activities conventionally associated with them. Recently, the analysis of visual images has also enriched the scope of how events can be identified, by anchoring both linguistic expressions and ontological labels to segments, subregions, and properties of images. By semantically grounding event descriptions in their visualization, the importance of object-based attributes becomes more apparent. In this position paper, we look at the narrative structure of objects: that is, how objects reference events through their intrinsic attributes, such as affordances, purposes, and functions. We argue that, not only do objects encode conventionalized events, but that when they are composed within specific habitats, the ensemble can be viewed as modeling coherent event sequences, thereby enriching the global interpretation of the evolving narrative being constructed.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a rich annotation scheme for the structure of mental events. Mental events are those in which the verb describes a mental state or process, usually oriented towards an external situation. While physical events have been described in detail and there are numerous studies of their semantic analysis and annotation, mental events are less thoroughly studied. The annotation scheme proposed here is based on decompositional analyses in the semantic and typological linguistic literature. The scheme was applied to the news corpus from the 2016 Events workshop, and error analysis of the test annotation provides suggestions for refinement and clarification of the annotation scheme.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cross-document event chain co-referencing in corpora of news articles would achieve increased precision and generalizability from a method that consistently recognizes narrative, discursive, and phenomenological features such as tense, mood, tone, canonicity and breach, person, hermeneutic composability, speed, and time. Current models that capture primarily linguistic data such as entities, times, and relations or causal relationships may only incidentally capture narrative framing features of events. That limits efforts at narrative and event chain segmentation, among other predicate tasks for narrative search and narrative-based reasoning. It further limits research on audience engagement with journalism about complex subjects. This position paper explores the above proposition with respect to narrative theory and ongoing research on segmenting event chains into narrative units. Our own work in progress approaches this task using event segmentation, word embeddings, and variable length pattern matching in a corpus of 2,000 articles describing environmental events. Our position is that narrative features may or may not be implicitly captured by current methods explicitly focused on events as linguistic phenomena, that they are not explicitly captured, and that further research is required.</abstract>

    <abstract>Discourse structure is a key aspect of all forms of text, providing valuable information both to humans and machines. We applied the hierarchical theory of news discourse developed by van Dijk to examine how paragraphs operate as units of discourse structure within news articles&#8211;-what we refer to here as document-level discourse. This document-level discourse provides a characterization of the content of each paragraph that describes its relation to the events presented in the article (such as main events, backgrounds, and consequences) as well as to other components of the story (such as commentary and evaluation). The purpose of a news discourse section is of great utility to story understanding as it affects both the importance and temporal order of items introduced in the text&#8211;-therefore, if we know the news discourse purpose for different sections, we should be able to better rank events for their importance and better construct timelines. We test two hypotheses: first, that people can reliably annotate news articles with van Dijk's theory; second, that we can reliably predict these labels using machine learning. We show that people have a high degree of agreement with each other when annotating the theory (F1 > 0.8, Cohen's kappa > 0.6), demonstrating that it can be both learned and reliably applied by human annotators. Additionally, we demonstrate first steps toward machine learning of the theory, achieving a performance of F1 = 0.54, which is 65% of human performance. Moreover, we have generated a gold-standard, adjudicated corpus of 50 documents for document-level discourse annotation based on the ACE Phase 2 corpus.</abstract>

    <abstract>This study evaluates the performance of four information extraction tools (extractors) on identifying health claims in health news headlines. A health claim is defined as a triplet: IV (what is being manipulated), DV (what is being measured) and their relation. Tools that can identify health claims provide the foundation for evaluating the accuracy of these claims against authoritative resources. The evaluation result shows that 26% headlines do not in-clude health claims, and all extractors face difficulty separating them from the rest. For those with health claims, OPENIE-5.0 performed the best with F-measure at 0.6 level for ex-tracting "IV-relation-DV". However, the characteristic linguistic structures in health news headlines, such as incomplete sentences and non-verb relations, pose particular challenge to existing tools.</abstract>

CrowdThruth methodology and metrics have been applied to select valid annotations from the crowd. We further run an in-depth analysis of the annotated data by comparing them with available expert data. Our results show a valuable use of crowdsourcing annotations for such complex semantic tasks, and suggest a new annotation approach which combine crowd and experts.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose a method to improve human activity recognition in video by leveraging semantic information about the target activities from an expert-defined linguistic resource, VerbNet. Our hypothesis is that activities that share similar event semantics, as defined by the semantic predicates of VerbNet, will be more likely to share some visual components. We use a deep convolutional neural network approach as a baseline and incorporate linguistic information from VerbNet through multi-task learning. We present results of experiments showing the added information has negligible impact on recognition performance. We discuss how this may be because the lexical semantic information defined by VerbNet is generally not visually salient given the video processing approach used here, and how we may handle this in future approaches.</abstract>

    <abstract>Journalists usually organize and present the contents of a news article following a well-defined structure. In this work, we propose a new task to categorize news articles based on their content presentation structures, which is beneficial for various NLP applications. We first define a small set of news elements considering their functions (e.g., introducing the main story or event, catching the reader's attention and providing details) in a news story and their writing style (narrative or expository), and then formally define four commonly used news article structures based on their selections and organizations of news elements. We create an annotated dataset for structure-based news genre identification, and finally, we build a predictive model to assess the feasibility of this classification task using structure indicative features.</abstract>

With the best model using textual features only we achieved 94.7% (92.9%) F1 score on GOLD (SILVER) dataset. These figures were further improved to 98.6% (GOLD) and 97% (SILVER) F1 score by adding meta-data features, mainly thanks to the strong discriminatory power of automatically extracted geographical information related to events.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we present the definition and implementation of the Hunter Events Interface (HEI) System. The HEI System is a system for events annotation and temporal reasoning in Natural Language Texts and media, mainly oriented to texts of historical and cultural contents available on the Web. In this work we assume that events are defined through various components: actions, participants, locations, and occurrence intervals. The HEI system, through independent services, locates (annotates) the various components, and successively associates them to a specific event. The objective of this work is to build a system integrating services for the identification of events, the discovery of their connections, and the evaluation of their consistency. We believe this interface is useful to develop applications that use the notion of story, to integrate data of digital cultural archives, and to build systems of fruition in the same field. The HEI system has been partially developed within the TrasTest project</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we present the report and findings of the Shared Task on Aggression Identification organised as part of the First Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying (TRAC - 1) at COLING 2018. The task was to develop a classifier that could discriminate between Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive, and Non-aggressive texts. For this task, the participants were provided with a dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments each in Hindi (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English for training and validation. For testing, two different sets - one from Facebook and another from a different social media - were provided. A total of 130 teams registered to participate in the task, 30 teams submitted their test runs, and finally 20 teams also sent their system description paper which are included in the TRAC workshop proceedings. The best system obtained a weighted F-score of 0.64 for both Hindi and English on the Facebook test sets, while the best scores on the surprise set were 0.60 and 0.50 for English and Hindi respectively. The results presented in this report depict how challenging the task is. The positive response from the community and the great levels of participation in the first edition of this shared task also highlights the interest in this topic.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes the process of building a cyberbullying intervention interface driven by a machine-learning based text-classification service. We make two main contributions. First, we show that cyberbullying can be identified in real-time before it takes place, with available machine learning and natural language processing tools. Second, we present a mechanism that provides individuals with early feedback about how other people would feel about wording choices in their messages before they are sent out. This interface not only gives a chance for the user to revise the text, but also provides a system-level flagging/intervention in a situation related to cyberbullying.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we describe the system submitted for the shared task on Aggression Identification in Facebook posts and comments by the team Nishnik. Previous works demonstrate that LSTMs have achieved remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks. We deploy an LSTM model with an attention unit over it. Our system ranks 6th and 4th in the Hindi subtask for Facebook comments and subtask for generalized social media data respectively. And it ranks 17th and 10th in the corresponding English subtasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes the work that our team bhanodaig did at Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) towards TRAC-1 Shared Task on Aggression Identification in Social Media for COLING 2018. In this paper we label aggression identification into three categories: Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive and Non-aggressive. We train a model to differentiate between these categories and then analyze the results in order to better understand how we can distinguish between them. We participated in two different tasks named as English (Facebook) task and English (Social Media) task. For English (Facebook) task System 05 was our best run (i.e. 0.3572) above the Random Baseline (i.e. 0.3535). For English (Social Media) task our system 02 got the value (i.e. 0.1960) below the Random Bseline (i.e. 0.3477). For all of our runs we used Long Short-Term Memory model. Overall, our performance is not satisfactory. However, as new entrant to the field, our scores are encouraging enough to work for better results in future.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes our system submitted in the shared task at COLING 2018 TRAC-1: Aggression Identification. The objective of this task was to predict online aggression spread through online textual post or comment. The dataset was released in two languages, English and Hindi. We submitted a single system for Hindi and a single system for English. Both the systems are based on an ensemble architecture where the individual models are based on Convoluted Neural Network and Support Vector Machine. Evaluation shows promising results for both the languages.The total submission for English was 30 and Hindi was 15. Our system on English facebook and social media obtained F1 score of 0.5151 and 0.5099 respectively where Hindi facebook and social media obtained F1 score of 0.5599 and 0.3790 respectively.</abstract>

    <abstract>The system presented here took part in the 2018 Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying shared task (Forest and Trees team) and uses a Gated Recurrent Neural Network architecture (Cho et al., 2014) in an attempt to assess whether combining pre-trained English and Hindi fastText (Mikolov et al., 2018) word embeddings as a representation of the sequence input would improve classification performance. The motivation for this comes from the fact that the shared task data for English contained many Hindi tokens and therefore some users might be doing code-switching: the alternation between two or more languages in communication. To test this hypothesis, we also aligned Hindi and English vectors using pre-computed SVD matrices that pulls representations from different languages into a common space (Smith et al., 2017). Two conditions were tested: (i) one with standard pre-trained fastText word embeddings where each Hindi word is treated as an OOV token, and (ii) another where word embeddings for Hindi and English are loaded in a common vector space, so Hindi tokens can be assigned a meaningful representation. We submitted the second (i.e., multilingual) system and obtained the scores of 0.531 weighted F1 for the EN-FB dataset and 0.438 weighted F1 for the EN-TW dataset.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present an approach to detect aggression from social media text in this work. A winner-takes-all autoencoder, called Emoti-KATE is proposed for this purpose. Using a log-normalized, weighted word-count vector at input dimensions, the autoencoder simulates a competition between neurons in the hidden layer to minimize the reconstruction loss between the input and final output layers. We have evaluated the performance of our system on the datasets provided by the organizers of TRAC workshop, 2018. Using the encoding generated by Emoti-KATE, a 3-way classification is performed for every social media text in the dataset. Each data point is classified as ‘Overtly Aggressive’, ‘Covertly Aggressive’ or ‘Non-aggressive’. Results show that our (team name: PMRS) proposed method is able to achieve promising results on some of these datasets. In this paper, we have described the effects of introducing an winner-takes-all autoencoder for the task of aggression detection, reported its performance on four different datasets, analyzed some of its limitations and how to improve its performance in future works.

    <abstract>With the advent of the read-write web which facilitates social interactions in online spaces, the rise of anti-social behaviour in online spaces has attracted the attention of researchers. In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically identifying aggression in social media posts. Our team, saroyehun, participated in the English track of the Aggression Detection in Social Media Shared Task. On this task, we investigate the efficacy of deep neural network models of varying complexity. Our results reveal that deep neural network models require more data points to do better than an NBSVM linear baseline based on character n-grams. Our improved deep neural network models were trained on augmented data and pseudo labeled examples. Our LSTM classifier receives a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.6425 to rank first overall on the Facebook subtask of the shared task. On the social media sub-task, our CNN-LSTM model records a weighted macro-F1 score of 0.5920 to place third overall.</abstract>

    <abstract>Aggression and related activities like trolling, hate speech etc. involve toxic comments in various forms. These are common scenarios in today’s time and websites react by shutting down their comment sections. To tackle this, an algorithmic solution is preferred to human moderation which is slow and expensive. In this paper, we propose a single model capsule network with focal loss to achieve this task which is suitable for production environment. Our model achieves competitive results over other strong baseline methods, which show its effectiveness and that focal loss exhibits significant improvement in such cases where class imbalance is a regular issue. Additionally, we show that the problem of extensive data preprocessing, data augmentation can be tackled by capsule networks implicitly. We achieve an overall ROC AUC of 98.46 on Kaggle-toxic comment dataset and show that it beats other architectures by a good margin. As comments tend to be written in more than one language, and transliteration is a common problem, we further show that our model handles this effectively by applying our model on TRAC shared task dataset which contains comments in code-mixed Hindi-English.</abstract>

    <abstract>Harmful speech has various forms and it has been plaguing the social media in different ways. If we need to crackdown different degrees of hate speech and abusive behavior amongst it, the classification needs to be based on complex ramifications which needs to be defined and hold accountable for, other than racist, sexist or against some particular group and community. This paper primarily describes how we created an ontological classification of harmful speech based on degree of hateful intent and used it to annotate twitter data accordingly. The key contribution of this paper is the new dataset of tweets we created based on ontological classes and degrees of harmful speech found in the text. We also propose supervised classification system for recognizing these respective harmful speech classes in the texts hence. This serves as a preliminary work to lay down foundation on defining different classes of harmful speech and subsequent work will be done in making it's automatic detection more robust and efficient.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes our participation in the First Shared Task on Aggression Identification. The method proposed relies on machine learning to identify social media texts which contain aggression. The main features employed by our method are information extracted from word embeddings and the output of a sentiment analyser. Several machine learning methods and different combinations of features were tried. The official submissions used Support Vector Machines and Random Forests. The official evaluation showed that for texts similar to the ones in the training dataset Random Forests work best, whilst for texts which are different SVMs are a better choice. The evaluation also showed that despite its simplicity the method performs well when compared with more elaborated methods.</abstract>

    <abstract>With the rise of user-generated content in social media coupled with almost non-existent moderation in many such systems, aggressive contents have been observed to rise in such forums. In this paper, we work on the problem of aggression detection in social media. Aggression can sometimes be expressed directly or overtly or it can be hidden or covert in the text. On the other hand, most of the content in social media is non-aggressive in nature. We propose an ensemble based system to classify an input post to into one of three classes, namely, Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive, and Non-aggressive. Our approach uses three deep learning methods, namely, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with five layers (input, convolution, pooling, hidden, and output), Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory networks (Bi-LSTM). A majority voting based ensemble method is used to combine these classifiers (CNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM). We trained our method on Facebook comments dataset and tested on Facebook comments (in-domain) and other social media posts (cross-domain). Our system achieves the F1-score (weighted) of 0.604 for Facebook posts and 0.508 for social media posts.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents the approach of the team &#x201c;groutar&#x201d; to the shared task on Aggression Identification, considering the test sets in English, both from Facebook and general Social Media. This experiment aims to test the effect of merging new datasets in the performance of classification models. We followed a standard machine learning approach with training, validation, and testing phases, and considered features such as part-of-speech, frequencies of insults, punctuation, sentiment, and capitalization. In terms of algorithms, we experimented with Boosted Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Parallel Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. One question appearing was how to merge datasets using different classification systems (e.g. aggression vs. toxicity). Other issue concerns the possibility to generalize models and apply them to data from different social networks. Regarding these, we merged two datasets, and the results showed that training with similar data is an advantage in the classification of social networks data. However, adding data from different platforms, allowed slightly better results in both Facebook and Social Media, indicating that more generalized models can be an advantage.</abstract>

    <abstract>The phenomenon of cyberbullying has growing in worrying proportions with the development of social networks. Forums and chat rooms are spaces where serious damage can now be done to others, while the tools for avoiding on-line spills are still limited. This study aims to as- sess the ability that both classical and state-of-the-art vector space modeling methods provide to well known learning machines to identify aggression levels in social network cyberbullying (i.e. social network posts manually labeled as Overtly Aggressive, Covertly Aggressive and Non- aggressive). To this end, an exploratory stage was performed first in order to find relevant settings to test, i.e. by using training and development samples, we trained multiple learning machines using multiple vector space modeling methods and discarded the less informative configurations. Finally, we selected the two best settings and their voting combination to form three compet- ing systems. These systems were submitted to the competition of the TRACK-1 task of the Workshop on Trolling, Aggression and Cyberbullying. Our voting combination system resulted second place in predicting Aggression levels on a test set of untagged social network posts.</abstract>

    <abstract>Social media platforms allow users to share and discuss their opinions online. However, a minority of user posts is aggressive, thereby hinders respectful discussion, and — at an extreme level — is liable to prosecution. The automatic identification of such harmful posts is important, be- cause it can support the costly manual moderation of online discussions. Further, the automation allows unprecedented analyses of discussion datasets that contain millions of posts. This system description paper presents our submission to the First Shared Task on Aggression Identification. We propose to augment the provided dataset to increase the number of labeled comments from 15,000 to 60,000. Thereby, we introduce linguistic variety into the dataset. As a consequence of the larger amount of training data, we are able to train a special deep neural net, which generalizes especially well to unseen data. To further boost the performance, we combine this neural net with three logistic regression classifiers trained on character and word n-grams, and hand-picked syntactic features. This ensemble is more robust than the individual single models. Our team named "Julian" achieves an F1-score of 60% on both English datasets, 63% on the Hindi Facebook dataset, and 38% on the Hindi Twitter dataset.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning architecture for text classification, named cross segment-and-concatenate multi-task learning (CSC-MTL). We use CSC-MTL to improve the performance of cyber-aggression detection from text. Our approach provides a robust shared feature representation for multi-task learning by detecting contrasts and similarities among polarity and neutral classes. We participated in the cyber-aggression shared task under the team name uOttawa. We report 59.74% F1 performance for the Facebook test set and 56.9% for the Twitter test set, for detecting aggression from text.</abstract>

    <abstract>Comment sections of online news providers have enabled millions to share and discuss their opinions on news topics. Today, moderators ensure respectful and informative discussions by deleting not only insults, defamation, and hate speech, but also unverifiable facts. This process has to be transparent and comprehensive in order to keep the community engaged. Further, news providers have to make sure to not give the impression of censorship or dissemination of fake news. Yet manual moderation is very expensive and becomes more and more unfeasible with the increasing amount of comments. Hence, we propose a semi-automatic, holistic approach, which includes comment features but also their context, such as information about users and articles. For evaluation, we present experiments on a novel corpus of 3 million news comments annotated by a team of professional moderators.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cyberbullying and cyberaggression are serious and widespread issues increasingly affecting Internet users. With the widespread of social media networks, bullying, once limited to particular places, can now occur anytime and anywhere. Cyberaggression refers to aggressive online behaviour that aims at harming other individuals, and involves rude, insulting, offensive, teasing or demoralising comments through online social media. Considering the dangerous consequences that cyberaggression has on its victims and its rapid spread amongst internet users (specially kids and teens), it is crucial to understand how cyberbullying occurs to prevent it from escalating. Given the massive information overload on the Web, there is an imperious need to develop intelligent techniques to automatically detect harmful content, which would allow the large-scale social media monitoring and early detection of undesired situations. This paper presents the Isistanitos’s approach for detecting aggressive content in multiple social media sites. The approach is based on combining Support Vector Machines and Recurrent Neural Network models for analysing a wide-range of character, word, word embeddings, sentiment and irony features. Results confirmed the difficulty of the task (particularly for detecting covert aggressions), showing the limitations of traditionally used features.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe the participation of team TakeLab in the aggression detection shared task at the TRAC1 workshop for English. Aggression manifests in a variety of ways. Unlike some forms of aggression that are impossible to prevent in day-to-day life, aggressive speech abounding on social networks could in principle be prevented or at least reduced by simply disabling users that post aggressively worded messages. The first step in achieving this is to detect such messages. The task, however, is far from being trivial, as what is considered as aggressive speech can be quite subjective, and the task is further complicated by the noisy nature of user-generated text on social networks. Our system learns to distinguish between open aggression, covert aggression, and non-aggression in social media texts. We tried different machine learning approaches, including traditional (shallow) machine learning models, deep learning models, and a combination of both. We achieved respectable results, ranking 4th and 8th out of 31 submissions on the Facebook and Twitter test sets, respectively.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes the participation of team DA-LD-Hildesheim from the Information Retrieval Lab(IRLAB) at DA-IICT Gandhinagar, India in collaboration with the University of Hildesheim, Germany and LDRP-ITR, Gandhinagar, India in a shared task on Aggression Identification workshop in COLING 2018. The objective of the shared task is to identify the level of aggression from the User-Generated contents within Social media written in English, Devnagiri Hindi and Romanized Hindi. Aggression levels are categorized into three predefined classes namely: ‘Overtly Aggressive‘, ‘Covertly Aggressive‘ and ‘Non-aggressive‘. The participating teams are required to develop a multi-class classifier which classifies User-generated content into these pre-defined classes. Instead of relying on a bag-of-words model, we have used pre-trained vectors for word embedding. We have performed experiments with standard machine learning classifiers. In addition, we have developed various deep learning models for the multi-class classification problem. Using the validation data, we found that validation accuracy of our deep learning models outperform all standard machine learning classifiers and voting based ensemble techniques and results on test data support these findings. We have also found that hyper-parameters of the deep neural network are the keys to improve the results.</abstract>

    <abstract>We propose to study the evolution of concepts by learning to complete diachronic analogies between lists of terms which relate to the same concept at different points in time. We present a number of models based on operations on word embedddings that correspond to different assumptions about the characteristics of diachronic analogies and change in concept vocabularies. These are tested in a quantitative evaluation for nine different concepts on a corpus of Dutch newspapers from the 1950s and 1980s. We show that a model which treats the concept terms as analogous and learns weights to compensate for diachronic changes (weighted linear combination) is able to more accurately predict the missing term than a learned transformation and two baselines for most of the evaluated concepts. We also find that all models tend to be coherent in relation to the represented concept, but less discriminative in regard to other concepts. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of aligning the time-specific embedding spaces using orthogonal Procrustes, finding varying effects on performance, depending on the model, concept and evaluation metric. For the weighted linear combination, however, results improve with alignment in a majority of cases. All related code is released publicly.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe a new project publishing a freely available online dictionary for Coptic. The dictionary encompasses comprehensive cross-referencing mechanisms, including linking entries to an online scanned edition of Crum's Coptic Dictionary, internal cross-references and etymological information, translated searchable definitions in English, French and German, and linked corpus data which provides frequencies and corpus look-up for headwords and multiword expressions. Headwords are available for linking in external projects using a REST API. We describe the challenges in encoding our dictionary using TEI XML and implementing linking mechanisms to construct a Web interface querying frequency information, which draw on NLP tools to recognize inflected forms in context. We evaluate our dictionary's coverage using digital corpora of Coptic available online.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a data-driven approach to detect periods of linguistic change and the lexical and grammatical features contributing to change. We focus on the development of scientific English in the late modern period. Our approach is based on relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler Divergence) comparing temporally adjacent periods and sliding over the time line from past to present. Using a diachronic corpus of scientific publications of the Royal Society of London, we show how periods of change reflect the interplay between lexis and grammar, where periods of lexical expansion are typically followed by periods of grammatical consolidation resulting in a balance between expressivity and communicative efficiency. Our method is generic and can be applied to other data sets, languages and time ranges.</abstract>

    <abstract>Should writers "avoid clich&#233;s like the plague"? Clich&#233;s are said to be a prominent characteristic of "low brow" literature, and conversely, a negative marker of "high brow" literature. Clich&#233;s may concern the storyline, the characters, or the style of writing. We focus on clich&#233; expressions, ready-made stock phrases which can be taken as a sign of uncreative writing. We present a corpus study in which we examine to what extent clich&#233; expressions can be attested in a corpus of various kinds of contemporary fiction, based on a large, curated lexicon of clich&#233; expressions. The results show to what extent the negative view on clich&#233;s is supported by data: we find a significant negative correlation of -0.48 between clich&#233; density and literary ratings of texts. We also investigate interactions with genre and characterize the language of clich&#233;s with several basic textual features.

    <abstract>We show how to classify the phrasing of readout poems with the help of machine learning algorithms that use manually engineered features or automatically learn representations. We investigate modern and postmodern poems from the webpage lyrikline, and focus on two exemplary rhythmical patterns in order to detect the rhythmic phrasing: The Parlando and the Variable Foot. These rhythmical patterns have been compared by using two important theoretical works: The Generative Theory of Tonal Music and the Rhythmic Phrasing in English Verse. Using both, we focus on a combination of four different features: The grouping structure, the metrical structure, the time-span-variation, and the prolongation in order to detect the rhythmic phrasing in the two rhythmical types. We use manually engineered features based on text-speech alignment and parsing for classification. We also train a neural network to learn its own representation based on text, speech and audio during pauses. The neural network outperforms manual feature engineering, reaching an f-measure of 0.85.</abstract>

    <abstract>Word choice is dependent on the cultural context of writers and their subjects. Different words are used to describe similar actions, objects, and features based on factors such as class, race, gender, geography and political affinity. Exploratory techniques based on locating and counting words may, therefore, lead to conclusions that reinforce culturally inflected boundaries. We offer a new method, the DualNeighbors algorithm, for linking thematically similar documents both within and across discursive and linguistic barriers to reveal cross-cultural connections. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations of this technique are shown as applied to two cultural datasets of interest to researchers across the humanities and social sciences. An open-source implementation of the DualNeighbors algorithm is provided to assist in its application.</abstract>

    <abstract>Measuring similarity is a basic task in information retrieval, and now often a building-block for more complex arguments about cultural change. But do measures of textual similarity and distance really correspond to evidence about cultural proximity and differentiation? To explore that question empirically, this paper compares textual and social measures of the similarities between genres of English-language fiction. Existing measures of textual similarity (cosine similarity on tf-idf vectors or topic vectors) are also compared to new strategies that strive to anchor textual measurement in a social context.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we tackle four different tasks of non-literal language classification: token and construction level metaphor detection, classification of idiomatic use of infinitive-verb compounds, and classification of non-literal particle verbs. One of the tasks operates on the token level, while the three other tasks classify constructions such as "hot topic" or "stehen lassen" ("to allow sth. to stand" vs. "to abandon so."). The two metaphor detection tasks are in English, while the two non-literal language detection tasks are in German. We propose a simple context-encoding LSTM model and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art on two tasks. Additionally, we experiment with different embeddings for the token level metaphor detection task and find that 1) their performance varies according to the genre, and 2) word2vec embeddings perform best on 3 out of 4 genres, despite being one of the simplest tested model. In summary, we present a large-scale analysis of a neural model for non-literal language classification (i) at different granularities, (ii) in different languages, (iii) over different non-literal language phenomena.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present the first supervised approach to rhyme detection with Siamese Recurrent Networks (SRN) that offer near perfect performance (97% accuracy) with a single model on rhyme pairs for German, English and French, allowing future large scale analyses. SRNs learn a similarity metric on variable length character sequences that can be used as judgement on the distance of imperfect rhyme pairs and for binary classification. For training, we construct a diachronically balanced rhyme goldstandard of New High German (NHG) poetry. For further testing, we sample a second collection of NHG poetry and set of contemporary Hip-Hop lyrics, annotated for rhyme and assonance. We train several high-performing SRN models and evaluate them qualitatively on selected sonnetts.</abstract>

The methods include machine translation (neural and statistical), edit distance and rule-based FST. Different normalization methods are compared and evaluated. All of the methods have their own strengths in word normalization. This calls for finding ways of combining the results from these methods to leverage their individual strengths.</abstract>

    <abstract>Can language analysis reveal the underlying social power relations that exist between participants of an interaction? Prior work within NLP has shown promise in this area, but the performance of automatically predicting power relations using NLP analysis of social interactions remains wanting. In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture that captures manifestations of power within individual emails which are then aggregated in an order-preserving way in order to infer the direction of power between pairs of participants in an email thread. We obtain an accuracy of 80.4%, a 10.1% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, in this task. We further apply our model to the task of predicting power relations between individuals based on the entire set of messages exchanged between them; here also, our model significantly outperforms the 70.0% accuracy using prior state-of-the-art techniques, obtaining an accuracy of 83.0%.</abstract>

We use weak supervision to identify pattern candidates and learn distributed representations for them. Given seed extraction patterns from existing pattern dictionaries, we use label propagation to label pattern candidates. We present two case studies. i) We derive patterns of acceptable quality for a number of international relations and conflicts categories using pattern candidates of O'Connor et al (2013). ii) We derive patterns for coding protest events that outperform an established set of Tabari / Petrarch hand-crafted patterns.</abstract>

    <abstract>The detection of reused text is important in a wide range of disciplines. However, even as research in the field of plagiarism detection is constantly improving, heavily modified or paraphrased text is still challenging for current methodologies. For historical texts, these problems are even more severe, since text sources were often subject to stronger and more frequent modifications. Despite the need for tools to automate text criticism, e.g., tracing modifications in historical text, algorithmic support is still limited. While current techniques can tell if and how frequently a text has been modified, very little work has been done on determining the degree and kind of paraphrastic modification—despite such information being of substantial interest to scholars. We present a human-interpretable, feature-based method to measure paraphrastic modification. Evaluating our technique on three data sets, we find that our approach performs competitive to text similarity scores borrowed from machine translation evaluation, being much harder to interpret.</abstract>

    <abstract>The presence of misspellings and other errors or non-standard word forms poses a considerable challenge for NLP systems. Although several supervised approaches have been proposed previously to normalize these, annotated training data is scarce for many languages. We investigate, therefore, an unsupervised method where correction candidates for Swedish language learners' errors are retrieved from word embeddings. Furthermore, we compare the usefulness of combining cosine similarity with orthographic and phonological similarity based on a neural grapheme-to-phoneme conversion system we train for this purpose. Although combinations of similarity measures have been explored for finding error correction candidates, it remains unclear how these measures relate to each other and how much they contribute individually to identifying the correct alternative. We experiment with different combinations of these and find that integrating phonological information is especially useful when the majority of learner errors are related to misspellings, but less so when errors are of a variety of types including, e.g.~grammatical errors.</abstract>

    <abstract>Coreference resolution is the task of grouping together references to the same discourse entity. Resolving coreference in literary texts could benefit a number of Digital Humanities (DH) tasks, such as analyzing the depiction of characters and/or their relations. Domain-dependent training data has shown to improve coreference resolution for many domains, e.g. the biomedical domain, as its properties differ significantly from news text or dialogue, on which automatic systems are typically trained. Literary texts could also benefit from corpora annotated with coreference. We therefore analyze the specific properties of coreference-related phenomena on a number of texts and give directions for the adaptation of annotation guidelines. As some of the adaptations have profound impact, we also present a new annotation tool for coreference, with a focus on enabling annotation of long texts with many discourse entities.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present results from a project in the research area of sentiment analysis of drama texts, more concretely the plays of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. We conducted an annotation study to create a gold standard for a systematic evaluation. The gold standard consists of 200 speeches of Lessing’s plays manually annotated with sentiment information. We explore the performance of different German sentiment lexicons and processing configurations like lemmatization, the extension of lexicons with historical linguistic variants or stop words elimination to explore the influence of these parameters and find best practices for our domain of application. The best performing configuration accomplishes an accuracy of 70%. We discuss the problems and challenges for sentiment analysis in this area and describe our next steps toward further research.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatically identifying persons in a particular role within a large corpus can be a difficult task, especially if you don’t know who you are actually looking for. Resources compiling names of persons can be available, but no exhaustive lists exist. However, such lists usually contain known names that are "visible" in the national public sphere, and tend to ignore the marginal and international ones. In this article we propose a method for automatically generating suggestions of names found in a corpus of Norwegian news articles, and which "naturally" belong to a given initial list of members, and that were not known (compiled in a list) beforehand. The approach is based, in part, on the assumption that surface level syntactic features reveal parts of the underlying semantic content and can help uncover the structure of the language.</abstract>

The RI comprise more than 150,000 digitized abstracts of medieval charters issued by the Roman-German kings and popes distributed over many European locations and a time span of more than 700 years. Our goal is to provide a resource for historians to visualize and query the RI, possibly aiding medieval history research.

    <abstract>This paper focuses on linguistic complexity from a relative perspective. It presents a grounded language learning system that can be used to study linguistic complexity from a developmental point of view and introduces a tool for generating a gold standard in order to evaluate the performance of the learning system. In general, researchers agree that it is more feasible to approach complexity from an objective or theory-oriented viewpoint than from a subjective or user-related point of view. Studies that have adopted a relative complexity approach have showed some preferences for L2 learners. In this paper, we try to show that computational models of the process of language acquisition may be an important tool to consider children and the process of first language acquisition as suitable candidates for evaluating the complexity of languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>There has been an upsurge of research interest in natural language complexity. As this interest will benefit from being informed by established contributions in this area, this paper presents a reasoned overview of central results concerning the computational complexity of natural language parsing. This overview also seeks to help to understand why, contrary to recent and widespread assumptions, it is by no means sufficient that an agent handles sequences of items under a pattern a^n b^n or under a pattern a^n b^m c^n d^m to ascertain ipso facto that this is the result of at least an underlying context-free grammar or an underlying context-sensitive grammar, respectively. In addition, it seeks to help to understand why it is also not sufficient that an agent handles sequences of items under a pattern a^n b^n for it to be deemed as having a cognitive capacity of higher computational complexity.</abstract>

    <abstract>Distributional Semantic Models have been successfully used for modeling selectional preferences in a variety of scenarios, since distributional similarity naturally provides an estimate of the degree to which an argument satisfies the requirement of a given predicate. However, we argue that the performance of such models on rare verb-argument combinations has received relatively little attention: it is not clear whether they are able to distinguish the combinations that are simply atypical, or implausible, from the semantically anomalous ones, and in particular, they have never been tested on the task of modeling their differences in processing complexity. In this paper, we compare two different models of thematic fit by testing their ability of identifying violations of selectional restrictions in two datasets from the experimental studies.</abstract>

    <abstract>We use two small parallel corpora for comparing the morphological complexity of Spanish, Otomi and Nahuatl. These are languages that belong to different linguistic families, the latter are low-resourced. We take into account two quantitative criteria, on one hand the distribution of types over tokens in a corpus, on the other, perplexity and entropy as indicators of word structure predictability. We show that a language can be complex in terms of how many different morphological word forms can produce, however, it may be less complex in terms of predictability of its internal structure of words.</abstract>

    <abstract>According to the UNIFORM INFORMATION DENSITY (UID) hypothesis (Levy and Jaeger, 2007; Jaeger, 2010), speakers tend to distribute information density across the signal uniformly while producing language. The prior works cited above studied syntactic reduction in language production at particular choice points in a sentence. In contrast, we use a variant of the above UID hypothesis in order to investigate the extent to which word order choices in Hindi are influenced by the drive to minimize the variance of information across entire sentences. To this end, we propose multiple lexical and syntactic measures (at both word and constituent levels) to capture the uniform spread of information across a sentence. Subsequently, we incorporate these measures in machine learning models aimed to distinguish between a naturally occurring corpus sentence and its grammatical variants (expressing the same idea). Our results indicate that our UID measures are not a significant factor in predicting the corpus sentence in the presence of lexical surprisal, a competing control predictor. Finally, in the light of other recent works, we conclude with a discussion of reasons for UID not being suitable for a theory of word order.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present the results of our investigations aiming at identifying the most informative linguistic complexity features for classifying language learning levels in three different datasets. The datasets vary across two dimensions: the size of the instances (texts vs. sentences) and the language learning skill they involve (reading comprehension texts vs. texts written by learners themselves). We present a subset of the most predictive features for each dataset, taking into consideration significant differences in their per-class mean values and show that these subsets lead not only to simpler models, but also to an improved classification performance. Furthermore, we pinpoint fourteen central features that are good predictors regardless of the size of the linguistic unit analyzed or the skills involved, which include both morpho-syntactic and lexical dimensions.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents an approach to evaluate complexity of a given natural language input by means of a Fuzzy Grammar with some fuzzy logic formulations. Usually, the approaches in linguistics has described a natural language grammar by means of discrete terms. However, a grammar can be explained in terms of degrees by following the concepts of linguistic gradience and fuzziness. Understanding a grammar as a fuzzy or gradient object allows us to establish degrees of grammaticality for every linguistic input. This shall be meaningful for linguistic complexity considering that the less grammatical an input is the more complex its processing will be. In this regard, the degree of complexity of a linguistic input (which is a linguistic representation of a natural language expression) depends on the chosen grammar. The bases of the fuzzy grammar are shown here. Some of these are described by Fuzzy Type Theory. The linguistic inputs are characterized by constraints through a Property Grammar.</abstract>

    <abstract>Given advances in computational linguistic analysis of complex languages using Machine Learning as well as standard Finite State Transducers, coupled with recent efforts in language revitalization, the time was right to organize a first workshop to bring together experts in language technology and linguists on the one hand with language practitioners and revitalization experts on the other. This one-day meeting provides a promising forum to discuss new research on polysynthetic languages in combination with the needs of linguistic communities where such languages are written and spoken.</abstract>

    <abstract>We experiment with training an encoder-decoder neural model for mimicking the behavior of an existing hand-written finite-state morphological grammar for Arapaho verbs, a polysynthetic language with a highly complex verbal inflection system. After adjusting for ambiguous parses, we find that the system is able to generalize to unseen forms with accuracies of 98.68% (unambiguous verbs) and 92.90% (all verbs).</abstract>

The resulting system decomposes the wide variety of surface forms in such a way that the morphological layer can be specified using unique and largely concatenative morphemes.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this article we describe the application of finite-state transducers to the morphological and phonological systems of Chukchi, a polysynthetic language spoken in the north of the Russian Federation. The language exhibits progressive and regressive vowel harmony, productive incorporation and extensive circumfixing. To implement the analyser we use the well-known Helsinki Finite-State Toolkit (HFST). The resulting model covers the majority of the morphological and phonological processes. A brief evaluation carried out on publically-available corpora shows that the coverage of the transducer is between and 53% and 76%. An error evaluation of 100 tokens randomly selected from the corpus, which were not covered by the analyser shows that most of the morphological processes are covered and that the majority of errors are caused by a limited stem lexicon.</abstract>

    <abstract>Kanyen’k&#233;ha (in English, Mohawk) is an Iroquoian language spoken primarily in Eastern Canada (Ontario, Qu&#233;bec). Classified as endangered, it has only a small number of speakers and very few younger native speakers. Consequently, teachers and courses, teaching materials and software are urgently needed. In the case of software, the polysynthetic nature of Kanyen’k&#233;ha means that the number of possible combinations grows exponentially and soon surpasses attempts to capture variant forms by hand. It is in this context that we describe an attempt to produce language teaching materials based on a generative approach. A natural language generation environment (ivi/Vinci) embedded in a web environment (VinciLingua) makes it possible to produce, by rule, variant forms of indefinite complexity. These may be used as models to explore, or as materials to which learners respond. Generated materials may take the form of written text, oral utterances, or images; responses may be typed on a keyboard, gestural (using a mouse) or, to a limited extent, oral. The software also provides complex orthographic, morphological and syntactic analysis of learner productions. We describe the trajectory of development of materials for a suite of four courses on Kanyen’k&#233;ha, the first of which will be taught in the fall of 2018.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we describe preliminary work on Kawenn&#243;n:nis, a verb conjugator for Kanyen'k&#233;ha (Ohsweken dialect). The project is the result of a collaboration between Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa Kanyen'k&#233;ha immersion school and the Canadian National Research Council's Indigenous Language Technology lab. The purpose of Kawenn&#243;n:nis is to build on the educational successes of the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa school and develop a tool that assists students in learning how to conjugate verbs in Kanyen'k&#233;ha; a skill that is essential to mastering the language. Kawenn&#243;n:nis is implemented with both web and mobile front-ends that communicate with an application programming interface that in turn communicates with a symbolic language model implemented as a finite state transducer. Eventually, it will serve as a foundation for several other applications for both Kanyen'k&#233;ha and other Iroquoian languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>Inuktitut is a polysynthetic language spoken in Northern Canada and is one of the official languages of the Canadian territory of Nunavut. As such, the Nunavut Legislature publishes all of its proceedings in parallel English and Inuktitut. Several parallel English-Inuktitut corpora from these proceedings have been created from these data and are publically available. The corpus used for current experiments is described. Morphological processing of one of these corpora was carried out and details about the processing are provided. Then, the processed corpus was used in morphological analysis and machine translation (MT) experiments. The morphological analysis experiments aimed to improve the coverage of morphological processing of the corpus, and compare an additional experimental condition to previously published results. The machine translation experiments made use of the additional morphologically analyzed word types in a statistical machine translation system designed to translate to and from Inuktitut morphemes. Results are reported and next steps are defined.</abstract>

    <abstract>Machine translation from polysynthetic to fusional languages is a challenging task, which gets further complicated by the limited amount of parallel text available. Thus, translation performance is far from the state of the art for high-resource and more intensively studied language pairs. To shed light on the phenomena which hamper automatic translation to and from polysynthetic languages, we study translations from three low-resource, polysynthetic languages (Nahuatl, Wixarika and Yorem Nokki) into Spanish and vice versa. Doing so, we find that in a morpheme-to-morpheme alignment an important amount of information contained in polysynthetic morphemes has no Spanish counterpart, and its translation is often omitted. We further conduct a qualitative analysis and, thus, identify morpheme types that are commonly hard to align or ignored in the translation process.</abstract>

    <abstract>Morphological analysis of morphologically rich and low-resource languages is important to both descriptive linguistics and natural language processing. Field documentary efforts usually procure analyzed data in cooperation with native speakers who are capable of providing some level of linguistic information. Manually annotating such data is very expensive and the traditional process is arguably too slow in the face of language endangerment and loss. We report on a case study of learning to automatically gloss a Nakh-Daghestanian language, Lezgi, from a very small amount of seed data. We compare a conditional random field based sequence labeler and a neural encoder-decoder model and show that a nearly 0.9 F1-score on labeled accuracy of morphemes can be achieved with 3,000 words of transcribed oral text. Errors are mostly limited to morphemes with high allomorphy. These results are potentially useful for developing rapid annotation and fieldwork tools to support documentation of morphologically rich, endangered languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this talk I will describe the interaction of linguistics and language technologies in Surface Construction Labeling (SCL) from the perspective of corpus annotation tasks such as definiteness, modality, and causality. Linguistically, following Construction Grammar, SCL recognizes that meaning may be carried by morphemes, words, or arbitrary constellations of morpho-lexical elements. SCL is like Shallow Semantic Parsing in that it does not attempt a full compositional analysis of meaning, but rather identifies only the main elements of a semantic frame, where the frames may be invoked by constructions as well as lexical items. Computationally, SCL is different from tasks such as information extraction in that it deals only with meanings that are expressed in a conventional, grammaticalized way and does not address inferred meanings. I review the work of Dunietz (2018) on the labeling of causal frames including causal connectives and cause and effect arguments. I will describe how to design an annotation scheme for SCL, including isolating basic units of form and meaning and building a "constructicon". I will conclude with remarks about the nature of universal categories and universal meaning representations in language technologies. This talk describes joint work with Jaime Carbonell, Jesse Dunietz, Nathan Schneider, and Miriam Petruck.</abstract>

    <abstract>I will describe an unorthodox approach to lexical semantic annotation that prioritizes corpus coverage, democratizing analysis of a wide range of expression types. I argue that a lexicon-free lexical semantics—defined in terms of units and supersense tags—is an appetizing direction for NLP, as it is robust, cost-effective, easily understood, not too language-specific, and can serve as a foundation for richer semantic structure. Linguistic delicacies from the STREUSLE and DiMSUM corpora, which have been multiword- and supersense-annotated, attest to the veritable smörgåsbord of noncanonical constructions in English, including various flavors of prepositions, MWEs, and other curiosities. Bio: Nathan Schneider is an annotation schemer and computational modeler for natural language. As Assistant Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science at Georgetown University, he looks for synergies between practical language technologies and the scientific study of language. He specializes in broad-coverage semantic analysis: designing linguistic meaning representations, annotating them in corpora, and automating them with statistical natural language processing techniques. A central focus in this research is the nexus between grammar and lexicon as manifested in multiword expressions and adpositions/case markers. He has inhabited UC Berkeley (BA in Computer Science and Linguistics), Carnegie Mellon University (Ph.D. in Language Technologies), and the University of Edinburgh (postdoc). Now a Hoya and leader of NERT, he continues to play with data and algorithms for linguistic meaning.</abstract>

    <abstract>Multiword expressions have posed a challenge in the past for computational linguistics since they comprise a heterogeneous family of word clusters and are difficult to detect in natural language data. In this paper, we present a fMRI study based on language comprehension to provide neuroimaging evidence for processing MWEs. We investigate whether different MWEs have distinct neural bases, e.g. if verbal MWEs involve separate brain areas from non-verbal MWEs and if MWEs with varying levels of cohesiveness activate dissociable brain regions. Our study contributes neuroimaging evidence illustrating that different MWEs elicit spatially distinct patterns of activation. We also adapt an association measure, usually used to detect MWEs, as a cognitively plausible metric for language processing.</abstract>

    <abstract>We conduct a corpus study to investigate the structure of multi-word expressions (MWEs) in the clinical domain. Based on an existing medical taxonomy, we develop an annotation scheme and label a sample of MWEs from a Dutch corpus with semantic and grammatical features. The analysis of the annotated data shows that the formal structure of clinical MWEs correlates with their conceptual properties. The insights gained from this study could inform the design of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems for clinical writing, but also for other specialized genres.</abstract>

    <abstract>Lexicons generally record a list of lexemes or non-compositional multiword expressions. We propose to build lexicons for compositional word combinations, namely &#x201c;secondary discourse connectives&#x201d;. Secondary discourse connectives play the same function as &#x201c;primary discourse connectives&#x201d; but the latter are either lexemes or non-compositional multiword expressions. The paper defines primary and secondary connectives, and explains why it is possible to build a lexicon for the compositional ones and how it could be organized. It also puts forward the utility of such a lexicon in discourse annotation and parsing. Finally, it opens the discussion on the constructions that signal a discourse relation between two spans of text.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents the results of two experiments carried out within the framework of computational construction grammar. Starting from the constructionist point of view that there are just constructions in language, including lexical ones, we tested the validity of a clustering algorithm that was primarily designed for MWE extraction, the cpr-score (Colson, 2017), on Chinese word segmentation. Our results indicate a striking recall rate of 75 percent without any special adaptation to Chinese or to the lexicon, which confirms that there is some similarity between extracting MWEs and CWS. Our second experiment also suggests that the same methodology might be used for extracting more schematic or abstract constructions, thereby providing evidence for the statistical foundation of construction grammar.</abstract>

    <abstract>We shed light on aspects of the relation between the semantics and the syntactic flexibility of multiword expressions by investigating fixed adjective similes (FS), a predicative multiword expression class not studied in this respect before. We find that only a subset of the syntactic structures observed in the data are related with idiomaticity. We identify and measure two aspects of idiomaticity, one of which seems to allow for predictions about FS syntactic flexibility. Our research draws on a resource developed with the semantic and detailed syntactic annotation of web-retrieved Modern Greek material, indicating frequency of use of the individual similes.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatic term identification and investigating the understandability of terms in a specialized domain are often treated as two separate lines of research. We propose a combined approach for this matter, by defining fine-grained classes of termhood and framing a classification task. The classes reflect tiers of a term’s association to a domain. The new setup is applied to German closed compounds as term candidates in the domain of cooking. For the prediction of the classes, we compare several neural network architectures and also take salient information about the compounds’ components into account. We show that applying a similar class distinction to the compounds’ components and propagating this information within the network improves the compound class prediction results.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we explore the challenges of building a computational lexicon for Moroccan Darija (MD), an Arabic dialect spoken by over 32 million people worldwide but which only recently has begun appearing frequently in written form in social media. We raise the question of what belongs in such a lexicon and start by describing our work building traditional word-level lexicon entries with their English translations. We then discuss challenges in translating idiomatic MD text that led to creating multi-word expression lexicon entries whose meanings could not be fully derived from the individual words. Finally, we provide a preliminary exploration of constructions to be considered for inclusion in an MD constructicon by translating examples of English constructions and examining their MD counterparts.</abstract>

    <abstract>Although English grammar encodes a number of semantic contrasts with tense and aspect marking, these semantics are currently ignored by Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) annotations. This paper extends sentence-level AMR to include a coarse-grained treatment of tense and aspect semantics. The proposed framework augments the representation of finite predications to include a four-way temporal distinction (event time before, up to, at, or after speech time) and several aspectual distinctions (including static vs. dynamic, habitual vs. episodic, and telic vs. atelic). This will enable AMR to be used for NLP tasks and applications that require sophisticated reasoning about time and event structure.</abstract>

    <abstract>Unlike corpora of written language where segmentation can mainly be derived from orthographic punctuation marks, the basis for segmenting spoken language corpora is not predetermined by the primary data, but rather has to be established by the corpus compilers. This impedes consistent querying and visualization of such data. Several ways of segmenting have been proposed, some of which are based on syntax. In this study, we developed and evaluated annotation and segmentation guidelines in reference to the topological field model for German. We can show that these guidelines are used consistently across annotators. We also investigated the influence of various interactional settings with a rather simple measure, the word-count per segment and unit-type. We observed that the word count and the distribution of each unit type differ in varying interactional settings and that our developed segmentation and annotation guidelines are used consistently across annotators. In conclusion, our syntax-based segmentations reflect interactional properties that are intrinsic to the social interactions that participants are involved in. This can be used for further analysis of social interaction and opens the possibility for automatic segmentation of transcripts.</abstract>

    <abstract>Corpora with language learner writing usually consist of essays, which are difficult to annotate reliably and to process automatically due to the high degree of freedom and the nature of learner language. We develop a task which mildly constrains learner utterances to facilitate consistent annotation and reliable automatic processing but at the same time does not prime learners with textual information. In this task, learners retell a comic strip. We present the resulting task-based corpus of stories written by learners of German. We designed the corpus to be able to serve multiple purposes: The corpus was manually annotated, including target hypotheses and syntactic structures. We achieve a very high inter-annotator agreement: κ = 0.765 for the annotation of minimal target hypotheses and κ = 0.507 for the extended target hypotheses. We attribute this to the design of our task and the annotation guidelines, which are based on those for the Falko corpus (Reznicek et al., 2012).</abstract>

    <abstract>When a hazard such as a hurricane threatens, people are forced to make a wide variety of decisions, and the information they receive and produce can influence their own and others' actions. As social media grows more popular, an increasing number of people are using social media platforms to obtain and share information about approaching threats and discuss their interpretations of the threat and their protective decisions. This work aims to improve understanding of natural disasters through social media and provide an annotation scheme to identify themes in user's social media behavior and facilitate efforts in supervised machine learning. To that end, this work has three contributions: (1) the creation of an annotation scheme to consistently identify hazard-related themes in Twitter, (2) an overview of agreement rates and difficulties in identifying annotation categories, and (3) a public release of both the dataset and guidelines developed from this scheme.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a treebank for the healthcare domain developed at ezDI. The treebank is created from a wide array of clinical health record documents across hospitals. The data has been de-identified and annotated for constituent syntactic structure. The treebank contains a total of 52053 sentences that have been sampled for subdomains as well as linguistic variations. The paper outlines the sampling process followed to ensure a better domain representation in the corpus, the annotation process and challenges, and corpus statistics. The Penn Treebank tagset and guidelines were largely followed, but there were many syntactic contexts that warranted adaptation of the guidelines. The treebank created was used to re-train the Berkeley parser and the Stanford parser. These parsers were also trained with the GENIA treebank for comparative quality assessment. Our treebank yielded great-er accuracy on both parsers. Berkeley parser performed better on our treebank with an average F1 measure of 91 across 5-folds. This was a significant jump from the out-of-the-box F1 score of 70 on Berkeley parser's default grammar.</abstract>

As two of the most spoken languages in the world, discourse analysis between Spanish and Chinese is important for NLP research. This paper aims to present the first open Spanish-Chinese parallel corpus annotated with discourse information, whose theoretical framework is based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). We have evaluated and harmonized each annotation part to obtain a high annotated-quality corpus. The corpus is already available to the public.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe and evaluate different approaches to the conversion of gold standard corpus data from Stanford Typed Dependencies (SD) and Penn-style constituent trees to the latest English Universal Dependencies representation (UD 2.2). Our results indicate that pure SD to UD conversion is highly accurate across multiple genres, resulting in around 1.5% errors, but can be improved further to fewer than 0.5% errors given access to annotations beyond the pure syntax tree, such as entity types and coreference resolution, which are necessary for correct generation of several UD relations. We show that constituent-based conversion using CoreNLP (with automatic NER) performs substantially worse in all genres, including when using gold constituent trees, primarily due to underspecification of phrasal grammatical functions.</abstract>

    <abstract>Disambiguation of potentially idiomatic expressions involves determining the sense of a potentially idiomatic expression in a given context, e.g. determining that make hay in `Investment banks made hay while takeovers shone.' is used in a figurative sense. This enables automatic interpretation of idiomatic expressions, which is important for applications like machine translation and sentiment analysis. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach for English that makes use of literalisations of idiom senses to improve disambiguation, which is based on the lexical cohesion graph-based method by Sporleder and Li (2009). Experimental results show that, while literalisation carries novel information, its performance falls short of that of state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we propose the first model for multiword expression (MWE) compositionality prediction based on character-level neural network language models. Experimental results on two kinds of MWEs (noun compounds and verb-particle constructions) and two languages (English and German) suggest that character-level neural network language models capture knowledge of multiword expression compositionality, in particular for English noun compounds and the particle component of English verb-particle constructions. In contrast to many other approaches to MWE compositionality prediction, this character-level approach does not require token-level identification of MWEs in a training corpus, and can potentially predict the compositionality of out-of-vocabulary MWEs.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present tools for lexicon and corpus management that offer cooperating functionality in corpus annotation. The former, named Cradle, stores a set of words and expressions where multi-word expressions are defined with their own part-of-speech information and internal syntactic structures. The latter, named ChaKi, manages text corpora with part-of-speech (POS) and syntactic dependency structure annotations. Those two tools cooperate so that the words and multi-word expressions stored in Cradle are directly referred to by ChaKi in conducting corpus annotation, and the words and expressions annotated in ChaKi can be output as a list of lexical entities that are to be stored in Cradle.</abstract>

    <abstract>This article presents the results we obtained in crowdsourcing French speakers’ intuition concerning multi-work expressions (MWEs). We developed a slightly gamified crowdsourcing platform, part of which is designed to test users’ ability to identify MWEs with no prior training. The participants perform relatively well at the task, with a recall reaching 65% for MWEs that do not behave as function words.</abstract>

    <abstract>Automatic syntactic parsing for question constructions is a challenging task due to the paucity of training examples in most treebanks. The near absence of question constructions is due to the dominance of the news domain in treebanking efforts. In this paper, we compare two synthetic low-cost question treebank creation methods with a conventional manual high-cost annotation method in the context of three domains (news questions, political talk shows, and chatbots) for Modern Standard Arabic, a language with relatively low resources and rich morphology. Our results show that synthetic methods can be effective at significantly reducing parsing errors for a target domain without having to invest large resources on manual annotation; and the combination of manual and synthetic methods is our best domain-independent performer.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes the PARSEME Shared Task 1.1 on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions. We present the annotation methodology, focusing on changes from last year's shared task. Novel aspects include enhanced annotation guidelines, additional annotated data for most languages, corpora for some new languages, and new evaluation settings. Corpora were created for 20 languages, which are also briefly discussed. We report organizational principles behind the shared task and the evaluation metrics employed for ranking. The 17 participating systems, their methods and obtained results are also presented and analysed.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes two systems for detecting Verbal Multiword Expressions (VMWEs) which both competed in the closed track at the PARSEME VMWE Shared Task 2018. CRF-DepTree-categs implements an approach based on the dependency tree, intended to exploit the syntactic and semantic relations between tokens; CRF-Seq-nocategs implements a robust sequential method which requires only lemmas and morphosyntactic tags. Both systems ranked in the top half of the ranking, the latter ranking second for token-based evaluation. The code for both systems is published under the GNU General Public License version 3.0 and is available at http://github.com/erwanm/adapt-vmwe18.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes the Deep-BGT system that participated to the PARSEME shared task 2018 on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs). Our system is language-independent and uses the bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model with a Conditional Random Field layer on top (bidirectional LSTM-CRF). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one that employs the bidirectional LSTM-CRF model for VMWE identification. Furthermore, the gappy 1-level tagging scheme is used for discontiguity and overlaps. Our system was evaluated on 10 languages in the open track and it was ranked the second in terms of the general ranking metric.</abstract>

We show that this architecture achieves state-of-the-art results with minimum feature-engineering, just by relying on lexicalized and morphological attributes. We validate our approach in a multilingual setting, using standard MWE corpora supplied in the PARSEME Shared Task.</abstract>

Mumpitz consists of a Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units and a heuristic that leverages the dependency information provided in the PARSEME corpus data to differentiate VMWEs in a sentence. We submitted results for seven languages in the closed track of the task and for one language in the open track. For the open track we used the same system, but with pretrained instead of randomly initialized word embeddings to improve the system performance.</abstract>

    <abstract>We describe the TRAPACC system and its variant TRAPACCS that participated in the closed track of the PARSEME Shared Task 2018 on labeling verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs). TRAPACC is a modified arc-standard transition system based on Constant and Nivre's (2016) model of joint syntactic and lexical analysis in which the oracle is approximated using a classifier. For TRAPACC, the classifier consists of a data-independent dimension reduction and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for learning and labelling transitions. TRAPACCS extends TRAPACC by replacing the softmax layer of the CNN with a support vector machine (SVM). We report the results obtained for 19 languages, for 8 of which our system yields the best results compared to other participating systems in the closed-track of the shared task.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper describes a system submitted to the closed track of the PARSEME shared task (edition 1.1) on automatic identification of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs). The system represents VMWE identification as a labeling task where one of two labels (MWE or not-MWE) must be predicted for each node in the dependency tree based on local context, including adjacent nodes and their labels. The system relies on multiclass logistic regression to determine the globally optimal labeling of a tree. The system ranked 1st in the general cross-lingual ranking of the closed track systems, according to both official evaluation measures: MWE-based F1 and token-based F1.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper introduces zero-shot dialog generation (ZSDG), as a step towards neural dialog systems that can instantly generalize to new situations with minimum data. ZSDG requires an end-to-end generative dialog system to generalize to a new domain for which only a domain description is provided and no training dialogs are available. Then a novel learning framework, Action Matching, is proposed. This algorithm can learn a cross-domain embedding space that models the semantics of dialog responses which in turn, enables a neural dialog generation model to generalize to new domains. We evaluate our methods on two datasets, a new synthetic dialog dataset, and an existing human-human multi-domain dialog dataset. Experimental results show that our method is able to achieve superior performance in learning dialog models that can rapidly adapt their behavior to new domains and suggests promising future research.</abstract>

    <abstract>In cooperative dialogues, identifying the intent of ones conversation partner and acting accordingly is of great importance. While this endeavour is facilitated by phrasing intentions as directly as possible, we can observe in human-human communication that a number of factors such as cultural norms and politeness may result in expressing one's intent indirectly. Therefore, in human-computer communication we have to anticipate the possibility of users being indirect and be prepared to interpret their actual meaning. Furthermore, a dialogue system should be able to conform to human expectations by adjusting the degree of directness it uses to improve the user experience. To reach those goals, we propose an approach to differentiate between direct and indirect utterances and find utterances of the opposite characteristic that express the same intent. In this endeavour, we employ dialogue vector models and recurrent neural networks.</abstract>

    <abstract>Previous work has shown that conversants adapt to many aspects of their partners' language. Other work has shown that while every person is unique, they often share general patterns of behavior. Theories of personality aim to explain these shared patterns, and studies have shown that many linguistic cues are correlated with personality traits. We propose an adaptation measure for adaptive natural language generation for dialogs that integrates the predictions of both personality theories and adaptation theories, that can be applied as a dialog unfolds, on a turn by turn basis. We show that our measure meets criteria for validity, and that adaptation varies according to corpora and task, speaker, and the set of features used to model it. We also produce fine-grained models according to the dialog segmentation or the speaker, and demonstrate the decaying trend of adaptation.</abstract>

    <abstract>Dialogue personalization is an important issue in the field of open-domain chat-oriented dialogue systems. If these systems could consider their users' interests, user engagement and satisfaction would be greatly improved. This paper proposes a neural network-based method for estimating users' interests from their utterances in chat dialogues to personalize dialogue systems' responses. We introduce a method for effectively extracting topics and user interests from utterances and also propose a pre-training approach that increases learning efficiency. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed model can estimate user's interest more accurately than baseline approaches.</abstract>

    <abstract>The role of alignment between interlocutors in second language learning is different to that in fluent conversational dialogue. Learners gain linguistic skill through increased alignment, yet the extent to which they can align will be constrained by their ability. Tutors may use alignment to teach and encourage the student, yet still must push the student and correct their errors, decreasing alignment. To understand how learner ability interacts with alignment, we measure the influence of ability on lexical priming, an indicator of alignment. We find that lexical priming in learner-tutor dialogues differs from that in conversational and task-based dialogues, and we find evidence that alignment increases with ability and with word complexity.</abstract>

    <abstract>Casual conversation has become a focus for artificial dialogue applications. Such talk is ubiquitous and its structure differs from that found in the task-based interactions which have been the focus of dialogue system design for many years. It is unlikely that such conversations can be modelled as an extension of task-based talk. We review theories of casual conversation, report on our studies of the structure of casual dialogue, and outline challenges we see for the development of spoken dialog systems capable of carrying on casual friendly conversation in addition to performing well-defined tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>User Simulators are one of the major tools that enable offline training of task-oriented dialogue systems. For this task the Agenda-Based User Simulator (ABUS) is often used. The ABUS is based on hand-crafted rules and its output is in semantic form. Issues arise from both properties such as limited diversity and the inability to interface a text-level belief tracker. This paper introduces the Neural User Simulator (NUS) whose behaviour is learned from a corpus and which generates natural language, hence needing a less labelled dataset than simulators generating a semantic output. In comparison to much of the past work on this topic, which evaluates user simulators on corpus-based metrics, we use the NUS to train the policy of a reinforcement learning based Spoken Dialogue System. The NUS is compared to the ABUS by evaluating the policies that were trained using the simulators. Cross-model evaluation is performed i.e. training on one simulator and testing on the other. Furthermore, the trained policies are tested on real users. In both evaluation tasks the NUS outperformed the ABUS.</abstract>

    <abstract>To provide a better discussion experience in current argumentative dialogue systems, it is necessary for the user to feel motivated to participate, even if the system already responds appropriately. In this paper, we propose a method that can smoothly introduce argumentative dialogue by inserting an initial discourse, consisting of question-answer pairs concerning personality. The system can induce interest of the users prior to agreement or disagreement during the main discourse. By disclosing their interests, the users will feel familiarity and motivation to further engage in the argumentative dialogue and understand the system's intent. To verify the effectiveness of a question-answer dialogue inserted before the argument, a subjective experiment was conducted using a text chat interface. The results suggest that inserting the question-answer dialogue enhances familiarity and naturalness. Notably, the results suggest that women more than men regard the dialogue as more natural and the argument as deepened, following an exchange concerning personality.</abstract>

In order to examine the generalization of such methods across language pairs and datasets, we analyze 10 different datasets of code-switched text. We extract a variety of character- and word-based text features and pass them into multiple learners, including conditional random fields, logistic regressors and recurrent neural networks. We further examine the efficacy of novel character-level embedding and GloVe features in improving performance and observe that our best-performing text system significantly outperforms a majority vote baseline across language pairs and datasets.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a modular, end-to-end dialogue system for a situated agent to address a multimodal, natural language dialogue task in which the agent learns complex representations of block structure classes through assertions, demonstrations, and questioning. The concept to learn is provided to the user through a set of positive and negative visual examples, from which the user determines the underlying constraints to be provided to the system in natural language. The system in turn asks questions about demonstrated examples and simulates new examples to check its knowledge and verify the user's description is complete. We find that this task is non-trivial for users and generates natural language that is varied yet understood by our deep language understanding architecture.</abstract>

    <abstract>Speech overlap is a common phenomenon in natural conversation and in task-oriented interactions. As human-robot interaction (HRI) becomes more sophisticated, the need to effectively manage turn-taking and resolve overlap becomes more important. In this paper, we introduce a computational model for speech overlap resolution in embodied artificial agents. The model identifies when overlap has occurred and uses timing information, dialogue history, and the agent's goals to generate context-appropriate behavior. We implement this model in a Nao robot using the DIARC cognitive robotic architecture. The model is evaluated on a corpus of task-oriented human dialogue, and we find that the robot can replicate many of the most common overlap resolution behaviors found in the human data.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper identifies stylistic differences in instruction-giving observed in a corpus of human-robot dialogue. Differences in verbosity and structure (i.e., single-intent vs. multi-intent instructions) arose naturally without restrictions or prior guidance on how users should speak with the robot. Different styles were found to produce different rates of miscommunication, and correlations were found between style differences and individual user variation, trust, and interaction experience with the robot. Understanding potential consequences and factors that influence style can inform design of dialogue systems that are robust to natural variation from human users.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper, we apply the contribution model of grounding to a corpus of human-human peer-mentoring dialogues. From this analysis, we propose effective turn-taking strategies for human-robot interaction with a teachable robot. Specifically, we focus on (1) how robots can encourage humans to present and (2) how robots can signal that they are going to begin a new presentation. We evaluate the strategies against a corpus of human-robot dialogues and offer three guidelines for teachable robots to follow to achieve more human-like collaborative dialogue.</abstract>

    <abstract>When interacting with robots in a situated spoken dialogue setting, human dialogue partners tend to assign anthropomorphic and social characteristics to those robots. In this paper, we explore the age and educational level that human dialogue partners assign to three different robotic systems, including an un-embodied spoken dialogue system. We found that how a robot speaks is as important to human perceptions as the way the robot looks. Using the data from our experiment, we derived prosodic, emotional, and linguistic features from the participants to train and evaluate a classifier that predicts perceived intelligence, age, and education level.</abstract>

    <abstract>Creating an intelligent conversational system that understands vision and language is one of the ultimate goals in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Extensive research has focused on vision-to-language generation, however, limited research has touched on combining these two modalities in a goal-driven dialog context. We propose a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically integrates vision and language for task-oriented visual dialog. The framework jointly learns the multimodal dialog state representation and the hierarchical dialog policy to improve both dialog task success and efficiency. We also propose a new technique, state adaptation, to integrate context awareness in the dialog state representation. We evaluate the proposed framework and the state adaptation technique in an image guessing game and achieve promising results.</abstract>

    <abstract>The utility of collaborative manipulators for shared tasks is highly dependent on the speed and accuracy of communication between the human and the robot. The run-time of recently developed probabilistic inference models for situated symbol grounding of natural language instructions depends on the complexity of the representation of the environment in which they reason. As we move towards more complex bi-directional interactions, tasks, and environments, we need intelligent perception models that can selectively infer precise pose, semantics, and affordances of the objects when inferring exhaustively detailed world models is inefficient and prohibits real-time interaction with these robots. In this paper we propose a model of language and perception for the problem of adapting the configuration of the robot perception pipeline for tasks where constructing exhaustively detailed models of the environment is inefficient and inconsequential for symbol grounding. We present experimental results from a synthetic corpus of natural language instructions for robot manipulation in example environments. The results demonstrate that by adapting perception we get significant gains in terms of run-time for perception and situated symbol grounding of the language instructions without a loss in the accuracy of the latter.</abstract>

    <abstract>Positive emotion elicitation seeks to improve user's emotional state through dialogue system interaction, where a chat-based scenario is layered with an implicit goal to address user's emotional needs. Standard neural dialogue system approaches still fall short in this situation as they tend to generate only short, generic responses. Learning from expert actions is critical, as these potentially differ from standard dialogue acts. In this paper, we propose using a hierarchical neural network for response generation that is conditioned on 1) expert's action, 2) dialogue context, and 3) user emotion, encoded from user input. We construct a corpus of interactions between a counselor and 30 participants following a negative emotional exposure to learn expert actions and responses in a positive emotion elicitation scenario. Instead of relying on the expensive, labor intensive, and often ambiguous human annotations, we unsupervisedly cluster the expert's responses and use the resulting labels to train the network. Our experiments and evaluation show that the proposed approach yields lower perplexity and generates a larger variety of responses.</abstract>

In contrast to previous work, these user groups are not specified beforehand, but learned in training. We evaluate on two referring expression (RE) generation tasks; our experiments show that our model can identify user groups and learn how to most effectively talk to them, and can dynamically assign unseen users to the correct groups as they interact with the system.</abstract>

    <abstract>Natural language generators for task-oriented dialogue must effectively realize system dialogue actions and their associated semantics. In many applications, it is also desirable for generators to control the style of an utterance. To date, work on task-oriented neural generation has primarily focused on semantic fidelity rather than achieving stylistic goals, while work on style has been done in contexts where it is difficult to measure content preservation. Here we present three different sequence-to-sequence models and carefully test how well they disentangle content and style. We use a statistical generator, Personage, to synthesize a new corpus of over 88,000 restaurant domain utterances whose style varies according to models of personality, giving us total control over both the semantic content and the stylistic variation in the training data. We then vary the amount of explicit stylistic supervision given to the three models. We show that our most explicit model can simultaneously achieve high fidelity to both semantic and stylistic goals: this model adds a context vector of 36 stylistic parameters as input to the hidden state of the encoder at each time step, showing the benefits of explicit stylistic supervision, even when the amount of training data is large.</abstract>

    <abstract>Natural language generation (NLG) is an important component in spoken dialog systems (SDSs). A model for NLG involves sequence to sequence learning. State-of-the-art NLG models are built using recurrent neural network (RNN) based sequence to sequence models (Ondřej Dušek and Filip Jurčı́ček, 2016a). Convolutional sequence to sequence based models have been used in the domain of machine translation but their application as Natural Language Generators in dialogue systems is still unexplored. In this work, we propose a novel approach to NLG using convolutional neural network (CNN) based sequence to sequence learning. CNN-based approach allows to build a hierarchical model which encapsulates dependencies between words via shorter path unlike RNNs. In contrast to recurrent models, convolutional approach allows for efficient utilization of computational resources by parallelizing computations over all elements, and eases the learning process by applying constant number of nonlinearities. We also propose to use CNN-based reranker for obtaining responses having semantic correspondence with input dialogue acts. The proposed model is capable of entrainment. Studies using a standard dataset shows the effectiveness of the proposed CNN-based approach to NLG.</abstract>

    <abstract>In spoken dialog systems (SDSs), dialog act (DA) segmentation and recognition provide essential information for response generation. A majority of previous works assumed ground-truth segmentation of DA units, which is not available from automatic speech recognition (ASR) in SDS. We propose a unified architecture based on neural networks, which consists of a sequence tagger for segmentation and a classifier for recognition. The DA recognition model is based on hierarchical neural networks to incorporate the context of preceding sentences. We investigate sharing some layers of the two components so that they can be trained jointly and learn generalized features from both tasks. An evaluation on the Switchboard Dialog Act (SwDA) corpus shows that the jointly-trained models outperform independently-trained models, single-step models, and other reported results in DA segmentation, recognition, and joint tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>Dialogue state tracking (DST), when formulated as a supervised learning problem, relies on labelled data. Since dialogue state annotation usually requires labelling all turns of a single dialogue and utilizing context information, it is very expensive to annotate all available unlabelled data. In this paper, a novel cost-sensitive active learning framework is proposed based on a set of new dialogue-level query strategies. This is the first attempt to apply active learning for dialogue state tracking. Experiments on DSTC2 show that active learning with mixed data query strategies can effectively achieve the same DST performance with significantly less data annotation compared to traditional training approaches.</abstract>

    <abstract>To date there has been very little work on assessing discourse coherence methods on real-world data. To address this, we present a new corpus of real-world texts (GCDC) as well as the first large-scale evaluation of leading discourse coherence algorithms. We show that neural models, including two that we introduce here (SentAvg and ParSeq), tend to perform best. We analyze these performance differences and discuss patterns we observed in low coherence texts in four domains.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper proposes a fully neural network based dialogue-context online end-of-turn detection method that can utilize long-range interactive information extracted from both speaker's utterances and collocutor's utterances. The proposed method combines multiple time-asynchronous long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, which can capture speaker's and collocutor's multiple sequential features, and their interactions. On the assumption of applying the proposed method to spoken dialogue systems, we introduce speaker's acoustic sequential features and collocutor's linguistic sequential features, each of which can be extracted in an online manner. Our evaluation confirms the effectiveness of taking dialogue context formed by the speaker's utterances and collocutor's utterances into consideration.</abstract>

    <abstract>Aiming to expand the current research paradigm for training conversational AI agents that can address real-world challenges, we take a step away from traditional slot-filling goal-oriented spoken dialogue systems (SDS) and model the dialogue in a way that allows users to be more expressive in describing their needs. The goal is to help users make informed decisions rather than being fed matching items. To this end, we describe the Linked-Data SDS (LD-SDS), a system that exploits semantic knowledge bases that connect to linked data, and supports complex constraints and preferences. We describe the required changes in language understanding and state tracking, and the need for mined features, and we report the promising results (in terms of semantic errors, effort, etc) of a preliminary evaluation after training two statistical dialogue managers in various conditions.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper examines a method to improve the user impression of a spoken dialog system by introducing a mechanism that gradually changes form of utterances every time the user uses the system. In some languages, including Japanese, the form of utterances changes corresponding to social relationship between the talker and the listener. Thus, this mechanism can be effective to express the system's intention to make social distance to the user closer; however, an actual effect of this method is not investigated enough when introduced to the dialog system. In this paper, we conduct dialog experiments and show that controlling the form of system utterances can improve the users' impression.</abstract>

    <abstract>This demonstration paper presents a bilingual (Arabic-English) interactive human avatar dialogue system. The system is named TOIA (time-offset interaction application), as it simulates face-to-face conversations between humans using digital human avatars recorded in the past. TOIA is a conversational agent, similar to a chat bot, except that it is based on an actual human being and can be used to preserve and tell stories. The system is designed to allow anybody, simply using a laptop, to create an avatar of themselves, thus facilitating cross-cultural and cross-generational sharing of narratives to wider audiences. The system currently supports monolingual and cross-lingual dialogues in Arabic and English, but can be extended to other languages.</abstract>

    <abstract>When creating a dialog system, developers need to test each version to ensure that it is performing correctly. Recently the trend has been to test on large datasets or to ask many users to try out a system. Crowdsourcing has solved the issue of finding users, but it presents new challenges such as how to use a crowdsourcing platform and what type of test is appropriate. DialCrowd has been designed to make system assessment easier and to ensure the quality of the result. This paper describes DialCrowd, what specific needs it fulfills and how it works. It then relates a test of DialCrowd by a group of dialog system developer.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a paradigm for interactive teacher training that leverages multimodal dialog technology to puppeteer custom-designed embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in student roles. We used the open-source multimodal dialog system HALEF to implement a small-group classroom math discussion involving Venn diagrams where a human teacher candidate has to interact with two student ECAs whose actions are controlled by the dialog system. Such an automated paradigm has the potential to be extended and scaled to a wide range of interactive simulation scenarios in education, medicine, and business where group interaction training is essential.</abstract>

    <abstract>Self-disclosure is a key social strategy employed in conversation to build relations and increase conversational depth. It has been heavily studied in psychology and linguistic literature, particularly for its ability to induce self-disclosure from the recipient, a phenomena known as reciprocity. However, we know little about how self-disclosure manifests in conversation with automated dialog systems, especially as any self-disclosure on the part of a dialog system is patently disingenuous. In this work, we run a large-scale quantitative analysis on the effect of self-disclosure by analyzing interactions between real-world users and a spoken dialog system in the context of social conversation. We find that indicators of reciprocity occur even in human-machine dialog, with far-reaching implications for chatbots in a variety of domains including education, negotiation and social dialog.</abstract>

    <abstract>Having consistent personalities is important for chatbots if we want them to be believable. Typically, many question-answer pairs are prepared by hand for achieving consistent responses; however, the creation of such pairs is costly. In this study, our goal is to collect a large number of question-answer pairs for a particular character by using role play-based question-answering in which multiple users play the roles of certain characters and respond to questions by online users. Focusing on two famous characters, we conducted a large-scale experiment to collect question-answer pairs by using real users. We evaluated the effectiveness of role play-based question-answering and found that, by using our proposed method, the collected pairs lead to good-quality chatbots that exhibit consistent personalities.</abstract>

    <abstract>Statistical spoken dialogue systems usually rely on a single- or multi-domain dialogue model that is restricted in its capabilities of modelling complex dialogue structures, e.g., relations. In this work, we propose a novel dialogue model that is centred around entities and is able to model relations as well as multiple entities of the same type. We demonstrate in a prototype implementation benefits of relation modelling on the dialogue level and show that a trained policy using these relations outperforms the multi-domain baseline. Furthermore, we show that by modelling the relations on the dialogue level, the system is capable of processing relations present in the user input and even learns to address them in the system response.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present "conversational image editing", a novel real-world application domain combining dialogue, visual information, and the use of computer vision. We discuss the importance of dialogue incrementality in this task, and build various models for incremental intent identification based on deep learning and traditional classification algorithms. We show how our model based on convolutional neural networks outperforms models based on random forests, long short term memory networks, and conditional random fields. By training embeddings based on image-related dialogue corpora, we outperform pre-trained out-of-the-box embeddings, for intention identification tasks. Our experiments also provide evidence that incremental intent processing may be more efficient for the user and could save time in accomplishing tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this work, we are interested in the computation of logical representations of discourse. We argue that all discourse connectives are anaphors obeying different sets of constraints and show how this view allows one to account for the semantically parenthetical use of attitude verbs and verbs of report (e.g., think, say) and for sequences of conjunctions (A CONJ_1 B CONJ_2 C). We implement this proposal in event semantics using de Groote (2006)'s dynamic framework.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this paper we have proposed a linguistically informed recursive neural network architecture for automatic extraction of cause-effect relations from text. These relations can be expressed in arbitrarily complex ways. The architecture uses word level embeddings and other linguistic features to detect causal events and their effects mentioned within a sentence. The extracted events and their relations are used to build a causal-graph after clustering and appropriate generalization, which is then used for predictive purposes. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed extraction model with respect to two baseline systems,one a rule-based classifier, and the other a conditional random field (CRF) based supervised model. We have also compared our results with related work reported in the past by other authors on SEMEVAL data set, and found that the proposed bi-directional LSTM model enhanced with an additional linguistic layer performs better. We have also worked extensively on creating new annotated datasets from publicly available data, which we are willing to share with the community.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a domain portable zero-shot learning approach for entity recognition in task-oriented conversational agents, which does not assume any annotated sentences at training time. Rather, we derive a neural model of the entity names based only on available gazetteers, and then apply the model to recognize new entities in the context of user utterances. In order to evaluate our working hypothesis we focus on nominal entities that are largely used in e-commerce to name products. Through a set of experiments in two languages (English and Italian) and three different domains (furniture, food, clothing), we show that the neural gazetteer-based approach outperforms several competitive baselines, with minimal requirements of linguistic features.</abstract>

Recently, Feudal Dialogue Management (FDM), has shown to increase the scalability to large domains by decomposing the dialogue management decision into two steps, making use of the domain ontology to abstract the dialogue state in each step. In order to abstract the state space, however, previous work on FDM relies on handcrafted feature functions. In this work, we show that these feature functions can be learned jointly with the policy model while obtaining similar performance, even outperforming the handcrafted features in several environments and domains.</abstract>

    <abstract>Cross-domain natural language generation (NLG) is still a difficult task within spoken dialogue modelling. Given a semantic representation provided by the dialogue manager, the language generator should generate sentences that convey desired information. Traditional template-based generators can produce sentences with all necessary information, but these sentences are not sufficiently diverse. With RNN-based models, the diversity of the generated sentences can be high, however, in the process some information is lost. In this work, we improve an RNN-based generator by considering latent information at the sentence level during generation using conditional variational auto-encoder architecture. We demonstrate that our model outperforms the original RNN-based generator, while yielding highly diverse sentences. In addition, our model performs better when the training data is limited.</abstract>

    <abstract>The research described in this paper examines how to learn linguistic knowledge associated with discourse relations from unlabeled corpora. We introduce an unsupervised learning method on text coherence that could produce numerical representations that improve implicit discourse relation recognition in a semi-supervised manner. We also empirically examine two variants of coherence modeling: order-oriented and topic-oriented negative sampling, showing that, of the two, topic-oriented negative sampling tends to be more effective.</abstract>

    <abstract>In this work, we propose an adversarial learning method for reward estimation in reinforcement learning (RL) based task-oriented dialog models. Most of the current RL based task-oriented dialog systems require the access to a reward signal from either user feedback or user ratings. Such user ratings, however, may not always be consistent or available in practice. Furthermore, online dialog policy learning with RL typically requires a large number of queries to users, suffering from sample efficiency problem. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial learning method to learn dialog rewards directly from dialog samples. Such rewards are further used to optimize the dialog policy with policy gradient based RL. In the evaluation in a restaurant search domain, we show that the proposed adversarial dialog learning method achieves advanced dialog success rate comparing to strong baseline methods. We further discuss the covariate shift problem in online adversarial dialog learning and show how we can address that with partial access to user feedback.</abstract>

    <abstract>We present a new lexicon of English discourse connectives called DiMLex-Eng, built by merging information from two annotated corpora and an additional list of relation signals from the literature. The format follows the German connective lexicon DiMLex, which provides a cross-linguistically applicable XML schema. DiMLex-Eng contains 149 English connectives, and gives information on syntactic categories, discourse semantics and non-connective uses (if any). We report on the development steps and discuss design decisions encountered in the lexicon expansion phase. The resource is freely available for use in studies of discourse structure and computational applications.</abstract>

    <abstract>Spoken language understanding (SLU) by using recurrent neural networks (RNN) achieves good performances for large training data sets, but collecting large training datasets is a challenge, especially for new voice applications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to maximize SLU performances, especially for small training data sets. To this aim, we propose a novel CRF-based dialog act selector which chooses suitable dialog acts from outputs of RNN SLU and rule-based SLU. We evaluate the selector by using DSTC2 corpus when RNN SLU is trained by less than 1,000 training sentences. The evaluation demonstrates the selector achieves Micro F1 better than both RNN and rule-based SLUs. In addition, it shows the selector achieves better Macro F1 than RNN SLU and the same Macro F1 as rule-based SLU. Thus, we confirmed our method offers advantages in SLU performances for small training data sets.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper explores the effect of emotional speech synthesis on a spoken dialogue system when the dialogue is non-task-oriented. Although the use of emotional speech responses have been shown to be effective in a limited domain, e.g., scenario-based and counseling dialogue, the effect is still not clear in the non-task-oriented dialogue such as voice chatting. For this purpose, we constructed a simple dialogue system with example- and rule-based dialogue management. In the system, two types of emotion labeling with emotion estimation are adopted, i.e., system-driven and user-cooperative emotion labeling. We conducted a dialogue experiment where subjects evaluate the subjective quality of the system and the dialogue from the multiple aspects such as richness of the dialogue and impression of the agent. We then analyze and discuss the results and show the advantage of using appropriate emotions for the expressive speech responses in the non-task-oriented system.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task learning of language understanding (LU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems. Multi-task training enables the sharing of the neural network layers responsible for encoding the user utterance for both LU and DST and improves performance while reducing the number of network parameters. In our proposed framework, DST operates on a set of candidate values for each slot that has been mentioned so far. These candidate sets are generated using LU slot annotations for the current user utterance, dialogue acts corresponding to the preceding system utterance and the dialogue state estimated for the previous turn, enabling DST to handle slots with a large or unbounded set of possible values and deal with slot values not seen during training. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and inference, we investigate the use of scheduled sampling on LU output for the current user utterance as well as the DST output for the preceding turn.</abstract>

    <abstract>This paper proposes a new weighting method for extending a dyad-level measure of convergence to multi-party dialogues by considering group dynamics instead of simply averaging. Experiments indicate the usefulness of the proposed weighted measure and also show that in general a proper weighting of the dyad-level measures performs better than non-weighted averaging in multiple tasks.</abstract>

    <abstract>Concept definition is important in language understanding (LU) adaptation since literal definition difference can easily lead to data sparsity even if different data sets are actually semantically correlated. To address this issue, in this paper, a novel concept transfer learning approach is proposed. Here, substructures within literal concept definition are investigated to reveal the relationship between concepts. A hierarchical semantic representation for concepts is proposed, where a semantic slot is represented as a composition of atomic concepts. Based on this new hierarchical representation, transfer learning approaches are developed for adaptive LU. The approaches are applied to two tasks: value set mismatch and domain adaptation, and evaluated on two LU benchmarks: ATIS and DSTC 2 and 3. Thorough empirical studies validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, we achieve state-of-the-art performance (F1-score 96.08%) on ATIS by only using lexicon features.</abstract>

    <abstract>The bulk of current research in dialogue systems is focused on fairly simple task models, primarily state-based. Progress on developing dialogue systems for more complex tasks has been limited by the lack generic toolkits to build from. In this paper we report on our development from the ground up of a new dialogue model based on collaborative problem solving. We implemented the model in a dialogue system shell (Cogent) that al-lows developers to plug in problem-solving agents to create dialogue systems in new domains. The Cogent shell has now been used by several independent teams of researchers to develop dialogue systems in different domains, with varied lexicons and interaction style, each with their own problem-solving back-end. We believe this to be the first practical demonstration of the feasibility of a CPS-based dialogue system shell.</abstract>

    <abstract>One important problem in task-based conversations is that of effectively updating the belief estimates of user-mentioned slot-value pairs. Given a user utterance, the intent of a slot-value pair is captured using dialog acts (DA) expressed in that utterance. However, in certain cases, DA's fail to capture the actual update intent of the user. In this paper, we describe such cases and propose a new type of semantic class for user intents. This new type, Update Intents (UI), is directly related to the type of update a user intends to perform for a slot-value pair. We define five types of UI's, which are independent of the domain of the conversation. We build a multi-class classification model using LSTM's to identify the type of UI in user utterances in the Restaurant and Shopping domains. Experimental results show that our models achieve strong classification performance in terms of F-1 score.</abstract>
